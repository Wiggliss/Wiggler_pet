                    <p> 
The Switch Axe is a weapon of finesse and precision, masked behind the sheer barbaric rage that is required to wield and use it properly. It is capable of consistently outputting staggering amounts of damage,
 but requires its user to invest time and effort into learning how to position properly, how to read moves and how to force openings. For this purpose, it provides all the necessary tools, all it asks is for you to use them.
Given the extreme skill ceiling presented in this franchise, this guide is aimed to relay information briefly and concisely. It will not help you learn positioning, explore all the niche uses or speedrun-specific conditions and match-ups, but is designed to help you understand:
<ul><li>Your moves;</li>
<li>how to identify your skill level</li></ul>
This notation: <span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span> refers to Sunbreak-exclusive moves
<br>
Remember to take your time. Don’t compare yourself to others, don’t let anyone tell you how you can and can’t enjoy the game you paid for. This doc does not exist to push a meta onto you, merely to guide those who are a little lost on their way to achieve measurable greatness.

Switch Axe revolves around two main mechanics: Amp and the Sword Gauge. Morphing into Sword, or attacking in Sword mode, as well as being in Counter Stance<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span> , consumes Sword Gauge.
                        <br>

                    Hitting a monster while Amped generates a small explosion, referred to as a Phial Tick. They attach to the space the monster and weapon met, not to the monster itself. Their damage can rival actual hits, which makes being Amped a top priority for Swaxe.

Utility Morphs: Dodgemorph
You can perform a Morph from either sword mode after any dodge. Going in a straight line, this can be used to cover a solid distance quickly.

Fig. 2.3A - Covering distance with Dodgemorphs
Switch Axe has very few, and arguably no, actual defensive tools or safety nets, relying mostly on positioning to not get hit. The Roll Morphs are a great asset for quickly moving a medium distance.
Utility Morphs: 360° Morphs
In addition to covering sheer distance with the morphs, they can also be used to reposition. After any Roll or Hop, the following morph is adjustable at a 360° Angle.

Fig. 2.3B - 360° Morph Showcase
This can be used for simple repositioning, but also aggressively to sneak in a few extra hits and phial ticks.
Axemode: Fade Slash
Holding Backwards and pressing A is the input for the Fade Slash. It can be chained to any move that ends in axe mode, including (but not limited to):
Heavy Slam
All Sword → Axe morphs
Forward Slash
Forward Overhead Slash

Fig. 2.3C - Examples of Fade Slash
Fade Slash is a fast repositioning tool that’s easy to combo into. Given the few defensive options Switch Axe has, it’s simultaneously viable and niche. It also enables positional dodges in conjunction with forward Axe → Sword morphs:

Fig. 2.3D - Dis- and Re-engaging with Fade Slash
Zero Sum Discharge (ZSD) and Soaring Wyvern Blade (SWB)
Using Elemental Discharge while Amped grants access to the Zero Sum Discharge, a very strong utility move that, unlike in World/Iceborne, will only end if you:
Get stunned
Get paralyzed
Die
Run out of sword gauge
Manually abort it.
Further unlike in World/Iceborne, you can cancel the long endlag at any point, provided you have Soaring Wyvern Blade (SWB) equipped and at least 1 Wirebug. SWB will have you end in Sword Mode, and the explosion it leaves behind will be stronger if you morph before it goes off, thanks to Rapid Morph.
Note that ZSD comes out faster if you use it immediately after Double Slash:

Fig. 2.3E - Left: “Raw” ZSD - Right: Double Slash → ZSD
In some situations you might find it advantageous to abort a ZSD without actually completing it. To do so, simply hold Backwards while mashing X:

Fig. 2.3F - Canceling ZSD
Note that manually canceled ZSDs will deal less damage than their completed iterations.
2-Staged Morphed Slash Combo<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span>
2Stage is a particularly strong tool for gauge and amp management, especially in combination with the Rampage decoration Phial Switch Boost (PSB). It is accessed from Wild Swing (X+A in Axe, Then A), by Pressing ZR to morph while equipped. While the first half of the move will generate Sword Gauge (and put you into Sword Mode regardless of gauge), the second half of 2Stage generates a lot of Amp, provided you hit with it:

Fig. 2.3G - From 0 to Amp with 2Stage and PSB
Further Gauge-Needs can be aided with a few Quickmorphs, provided you use Phial Switch Boost.

Fig. 2.3H - Quickmorphing for Sword Gauge
Note that quickmorphing is either a last-ditch effort or done for planning ahead. It is an option, but not a recommended one.
Wirestep<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span> and Switch Charger
Wirestep is the first contender for an actual defensive tool. Both it and Switch Charger fulfill roughly the same purpose: Iframes on start, repositioning in the process.

Fig. 2.3I - Iframing with Wirestep (Evade Extender 1)
Note that Wirestep’s default direction is to your characters’ right. After any attack, you can hold left to go that direction instead. It is strongly recommended to not use Evade Extender in conjunction with wirestep, because of the nearly uncontrollably large distance traveled, as shown in Figure 2.3I above.

Switch Charger on the other hand goes in a straight line, completely unaffected by Evade Extender, 

Fig. 2.3J - Iframing with Switch Charger, timer in hh:mm:ss:ff (frames)
and comes with the additional benefit of roughly 6.5 seconds of infinite sword gauge. This move is an amazing addition to the Swaxe Kit and feels extremely rewarding to use to its fullest effect. Unfortunately it shares its Switch Skill Slot with EBC and therefore goes mostly unused.
Invincible Gambit
Contrary to what its name might indicate, you’re not actually invincible with this move. Instead of Iframes, it comes with hyper armor instead. By pressing the A button after its completion, you get access to a (relatively) strong Side Slash. The angle of this move can be adjusted slightly as the animation plays out.

Fig. 2.3K - IMBECILE GAMBA Invincible Gambit
Note that Invincible Gambit will move you forward a lot and can occasionally move you straight through monsters, as demonstrated in Fig. 2.3K.

                        Note: Switch controls will be used in order to keep this section readable.
                        Switch axe has two big :eggplant: damage moves: Morph Loop and Elemental Burst Counter<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span>.
                        Morph Loop consists of (ZR) Overhead Slash (Axe→Sword) → (A) Double Slash → (ZR) Sword: Morph Double Slash. With the Phial Switch Boost rampage decoration<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span>, this can be repeated indefinetly.
                        The Morph Loop
                        
                        Fig. 2.2A - Morph Loop (gif)
                        Note: Clip is purposely unamped for better visibility.
                        It’s important to note that phial ticks not only count as full hits, but carry the same amount of element damage as normal weapon attacks, which can help with certain skills’ uptimes and conditions.
                        
                        Fig. 2.2B - Amped Morph Loop (gif)
                        Elemental Burst Counter<span class="tooltip">*<span class="tooltiptext">Sunbreak Exclusive</span></span>
                        The Elemental Burst Counter, referred to as EBC from now on, is the Swaxe Counter.
                        Upon successful Execution, it grants and refreshes Amp, while boasting stunningly high damage. These factors combined made it a very centralizing move. Despite being a counter, it is not a defensive “Oh :poop:” option, as the setup takes about one full second, which, in a game as fast as Sunbreak is a long ass time. As a Beginner, you’ll mostly practice using it on roars and other easily telegraphed moves, and mostly directly facing forward.

                        Elemental Burst Counter - A quick guide
The Elemental Burst Counter (EBC) is a stunningly good move. Boasting humongous damage potential, instantly amping and refreshing the amp timer, for the low cost of 2 relatively quickly regenerating bugs. The sheer damage it can dish out already gives it an edge over anything EBC would share its slot with (RIP switch charger), due to being a counter, it comes with Iframes to boot, if you successfully execute it. Even if you whiff, you get a slap that still deals respectable damage, alongside Hyper Armor (and reduced damage taken).
To use it, press ZL+A to enter the Counter Stance - this animation is almost a full second in length. Your sword gauge will drain while in the stance, and you need to manually press ZR just as you are about to get hit. This being the Swaxe counter, it naturally has some jank attached to it: EBC can whiff if you’re too close to the monster and escape the attack with the forward step or if the angle disagrees with you.

For Beginners it is recommended to try to angle directly into an attack while keeping roughly a roll’s worth of distance between you and your target. 

Fig. 2.4F - Comparing Angle and Timing
The simplified requirements of EBC are: Pressing ZR (slap) while anything with a hurtbox collides with both your weapon and your character.
EBC has a lot of janky interactions and possibilities, all of which range from easy to near frame-perfection to execute, with varying degrees of usefulness. Visit the 2.5 Advanced and Tech section if you’d like to learn more, but do not feel pressured to learn the stuff there; it’s mostly of the “interesting to know”-variety, or to flex on your friends.

                        The Switch Axe is a weapon with its roots in Jank. Below are some options resulting from that jank, aimed at the curious and those looking to flex. 
                        The Barrel Bomb EBC is a pretty useful tool to have, and the Backwards EBC helps illustrate how most people misunderstand the success conditions of this move.

                            You can proc EBC off of barrel bombs like so: <br>
                            <lite-youtube videoid="RQ3GgKW9WgI" class="GuideCard">
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ3GgKW9WgI" class="lty-playbtn" title="Play Video"><br>

                            <br>
                            This works due to hitlag. If you “slap” something with an adjusted Hitzone Value of 40 or higher (Sharpness Multiplier x HZV), you get quite a lot of hitlag. 
                            If, during that hitlag a bomb explodes, it counts as incoming attack and triggers your counter. This is a handy option for Sleeping monsters or long downs and you just ran out of amp.
                            <br> <span class="center"><u>Backwards EBC</u></span><br>
                            Despite what many guides, including this one, say, it is not required for an attack to be within a certain angle to be able to proc EBC.
                             <img src="images/switch_axe13.webp" class="GuideCard" alt="EBC Angle Misconception"><br>
                            
                            Many people seem to believe that the angle pictured is required for EBC to function. This, however, is a symptom but not the condition. What’s actually 
                            required is for a hurtbox to interact with both the weapon and the player character, either at once or in a specific order:
                            <br>

                              The backwards EBC can be proc’d off of large, fast hurtboxes, like Diablos’ Dig and Hipcheck. It can also be used to counter his notorious Hornstab, which can otherwise not be consistently countered forward.
                            <br>
                            The aforementioned jank techs have general use-cases. The following Entries will be way less commonly applicable, but are good to keep in the back of the mind as an option (or as a flex).

                               Instead of mashing X, you mash the SWB input, which skips the explosion. Note, however, that the Gauge is still consumed. The singular potential upside this has over just regularly aborting/exploding is that it's just that little bit quicker. Literal Frames.

                            Much like their big counterpart, small barrel bombs can also be used to proc EBC:

                               This specific EBC is <span class="tooltip"><u>frame perfect</u><span class="tooltiptext">but generously buffered, just mash button.</span></span> , very strict on positioning and can only be executed against walls and ledges. It may or may not be subject to internal lag and camera position. In solo gameplay, this can be used in times of extreme desperation. The biggest use case however is with small bomb-happy teammates in multiplayer, e.g. LS or Strongarm GS players.

                            Formerly a staple of the franchise and a relatively comfortable option in most older games, Rise dramatically reduced the amount of Iframes you get on a roll, all the way down to 4 (at 30 fps), making actually “rolling” moves a much more limited option. It’s important to note that you can still roll most roars and a lot of quick attacks, but due to how tight the timing is (usually you have 2 whole frames to choose from), it’s generally not advised to rely on it, at least without Embolden, Evade Window or some other form of increased iframes on dodge.

                        Rise, Sunbreak, Swaxe. What a ride.
Starting off as raw inclined as ever, slowly but steadily elemental powercreep set in. With the addition of qurious armor crafting, the set variety became greater than ever, 
making building and mathing out sets a more challenging and rewarding task than ever before. 
Over the course of theorycrafting and building for the meta, 
many connections were forged which slowly blossomed into friendships, rivalries and enemies. Many a meme was born and died unseen. 
Regardless of the general opinion of Swaxe and Risebreak, the game brought many people together, and I think that’s very cool and based. 
It’s sad to see the journey come to an end, but it is equally setting the stage for new beginnings and adventures. 

With the popularity of Worldborne, a glaring flaw with the Franchise was highlighted yet again: the abysmal conveying of information and stats. 
This led to many a frustrated hunter, due to the sheer amount of clickbaity misinformation and cryptic tables being circulated online, 
with no one safe go-to place to verify and double check the newfound takes and information. In turn, this led to many gimping themselves unknowingly and subsequent frustration with the perceived unfair tankiness of endgame hunts.
Annoyed by this, many skilled players and number crunchers sat and worked together, bonding over the desire to put things right.
And that's beautiful.


As the Author, I sincerely hope this guide will be of use to whoever stumbles upon it. 
Feedback is always welcome, and I’m happy to answer any question arising out of this to the best of my ability, or point you to someone who can.

In difficult times like these, it’s more important than ever to find ways to express oneself, to stay in touch and informed about those you love, 
and to stick together, as the arising challenges are greater than any one person can feasibly handle on their own. Stay safe, stay hydrated, and once in a while, touch grass and look at bird. Bird nice.
