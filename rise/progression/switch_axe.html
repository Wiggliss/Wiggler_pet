            This progression Guide is aimed at players who are new to the franchise, feel overwhelmed by all the options and choices the game offers, and those, who are just looking for a refresher or need some pointers for what to look out for during progression.<br>
            The Sets themselves aim to support you, from the start of the game all the way until the Endgame. From there, you should be in a great spot to follow the Endgame sets, accessible through the sidemenu or the buttons at the end of the page.

                            We don't really care about low rank gear. There's some staple skills found here or there, but the one Skill we really want on every set, Rapid Morph, is extremely limited this early on.<br>
                            Most of the recommendations until <span class="tooltip">RM<span class="tooltiptext">Rapid Morph</span></span> becomes more accessible are optional, in case you don't want to be naked.<br>
                            It’s a slightly different story for the Weapon choice, as there’s two options that can get you all the way into endgame that open up pretty much right out of the gate:
<table class="rawtable">

    <tbody>
        <tr>
    <td>Proto Iron Axe I (Ore Tree)</td>

    <td>Shrine Ruins, <span class="bluescroll">Blue Ore*</span></td>

        </tr>
</tbody>
<tfoot><td colspan=3>*Proto Iron Axe I can also be bought for 600z.</td></tfoot>
</table>
If you don’t see the option to upgrade or craft yet, keep progressing, this list just helps identifying the earliest point in time you can obtain the material.<br>
As for armor pieces, nothing is particularly great, as to be expected this early into the game. If you feel uncomfortable going naked, consider making the following pieces:<br>

heres where text describing the set goes<br>
Remember: If you don't see a monster mentioned here in your Quest List yet, just keep progressing. You can't miss anything, so don't worry about progressing too far or not completing every quest.

                        This is a Helmet you should get used to, as it's upgrades in <span class="tooltip">HR<span class="tooltiptext">High Rank, Hub Quests 4-8*</span></span> and in <span class="tooltip">MR<span class="tooltiptext">Master Rank, anything in Sunbreak Hub</span></span> will be recurring.<br>
                        The Almudron Hands are great too, but require a Plate to craft. Generally speaking, Plates are rare items with low (1-3%) droprates, and as such i try to avoid requiring them for Progression Sets as much as possible. No point keeping you locked in any place longer than you need to be.

        Armor-wise, Volvidon makes a comeback. Do note that the feet have Evade Extender 2, which can seriously throw off your positioning but is great for getting around. If you decide against them, use the Low Rank Almudron Helmet, the rest of the pieces are not overly important (yet).

yourself first, you can also try to get the full Valstrax Set, either at HR 100 or through his Event Quest. That set, with appropriate Decorations, will be good enough to skip every single MR set until Postgame-Progression (MR10+).<br>


</p>





<p>
Additionally, you now have access to most of the decorations, including some important ones.<br>
It's heavily recommended to craft the important ones now, or immediatly after you made your first MR set, assuming you have the Sunbreak DLC.<br>
The following Decorations will be relevant throughout the remainder of Base Rise, aswell as all of Sunbreak and just make Setbuilding so much easier.<br>
This guide assumes that you have the following decos in Master Rank:<br>

<!--With all that said and done, your set could now look something like this:
Slot
Gear
Skills
Head
Almudron S
Rapid Morph 2, 2 Lv. 2 Slot
Chest
Zinogre S
Weakness Exploit 1
Hands
Rathalos S

Feet

You can now rock a charmless RM3, Wex3, Ab4 set. It’s not much but it’s good enough for progression. You can (and kinda sorta should) farm decorations a bit from here, just to get the essentials together and a bit more practice:
3x Critical Boost, 3x Weakness Exploit, 1-3x Rapid Morph, 1-4x Attack Boost (optional), 1-2x Critical Eye (optional), 1-3x Handicraft, 3x Protective Polish, and 5x Fire/Water/… Attack decorations.
Whether you do this now or later is ultimately up to you though, note, however, that this guide assumes you do.

                        This guide will assume decorations and a charm of at least 2 level 2 slots from here on. Skills on the charm can replace decorations that would otherwise occupy level 2 slots, otherwise treat them as bonus.<br>
                        MR1 gives us access to the Barroth Hands and Chest, as well as the Hermitaur Waist. MR2 brings the Blood Orange Bishaten, and with it, the Orangaten Greaves. Finally, in MR3, Almudron Helmet gets replaced with it's MR equivalent.<br>
                        Putting all these together results in the set pictured.<br>

                        In terms of Weapons, it's ultimately preference between Conqueress and Shredder. Shredder is easier to manage in solo, Conqueress might yield better results in multiplayer due to its faster amp. Shredder will however be undisputably better by late MR4.
                        In MR1, both weapons can be upgraded:<br>

        Clear the upcoming Urgent Quests until you are tasked to hunt a Chaotic Gore Magala. Do so immediately to unlock a new melding method. A lot of options open up from here.<br>
        Your next goal is upgrading your weapon:

                                <tbody>
                                    <tr>
                                <td rowspan="4">Wicked Niddoq (Velkhana)</td>

                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                <td>2x Velkhana Crownhorn</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                <td class="dark">1x Velkhana Crystal</td>
                                    </tr>
                            </tbody>
                            <tfoot><td colspan="2">Material Requirements for Wicked Niddoq/Velkhana Switch Axe</td></tfoot></table>
                            The Wicked Niddoq is an insanely strong progression weapon, coming with natural purple sharpness, a level 3 rampage slot to fit Phial Switch Boost (PSB) and vastly more Attack (Raw) than anything else you can access at this point.
                            From here, hunt Amatsu until you can make its armor.<br>
        Note: This guide assumes better charms from here on out, don’t worry if you don’t have them yet, just upgrade as you get there.
        <section>
        The following set should carry you over into the Afflicted grind and, ultimately, the endgame sets.<br>

        <a href="sets/switch_axe8.webp" target="_blank" class="ImgButton">Open image in new tab</a><br>
        As you progress, add Ice Attack 5 and slowly transition into AB 7, add Intrepid Heart 1 as you unlock more decos. You can drop to PowPro 2 and add your preferred comfort skills that way, too. From here, the next set upgrade will be at MR140 and 160.
