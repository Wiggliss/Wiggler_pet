<td>Rapid Morph 3 (RM3)</td>
<td>The single most broken skill in the whole franchise, arguably. It boosts the animation speed and damage of morph attacks, which is 2 out of 3 moves of our main damage combo and a good number of utility options. Once you get access to it, never drop below 3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">2</th>
<td>Weakness Exploit 3 (Wex3)</td>
<td>50% affinity (crit chance) for hitting parts you want to hit in the first place - weakspots (HZV of 45 or above).
    While Phials don’t crit in this game, the majority of our big meaty swings can. Wex is the most efficient source of affinity. Use it, because -

<th scope="row">2</th>
<td>Critical Boost 3 (CB3)</td>
<td>- Critical hits deal 25% more damage in MH. Critical Boost 3 raises that that 40% more damage (total), or a factor of 1.4, making the Wex3 CB3 combination one of the best Return-on-Investment Skills in terms of Skill points → Damage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">3</th>
<td>Purple Sharpness + Maintenance</td>
<td>Sunbreak Swaxe is a much more elementally leaning weapon than its previous iterations.
    As such, it really enjoys the increased modifiers from Purple Sharpness and wants a way to keep it for as long as possible, ideally the whole hunt. 
    Early on, the easiest way to achieve this is enough Handicraft to reach purple (typically 3) and then opting for Protective Polish 3, which grants 90 seconds of no sharpness reduction.
    Later Sets opt for either Heaven-Sent 3 which gives flat out infinite sharpness, or 100% affinity + Master’s Touch 3, sometimes supplemented by Bladescale Hone or, rarely, Razor Sharp 3.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">3</th>
<td>100% Affinity</td>
<td>See the Wex and CB entries above. 
    More affinity = more damage = more hit stuff deader gooder.
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">3</td>
<td><span class="bluebg">Fire, Water... Attack 5 (Ele 5)</span></td>
<td rowspan="2">Swaxe being more elementally inclined makes us want to scale that element further. Note that both of these scale off of base element and as such don’t interact with other increases.
    If you’re very strapped for slots, Elder Bless gives the bigger bang for your buck, but on standard sets you’ll almost always be able (and want) to fit both.

<th scope="row">4a</th>
<td>Mail of Hellfire 3 (MoH3)</td>
<td><span class="redscroll">Raw Sets</span> use this on <span class="redscroll">Red Scroll</span>, <span class="bluescroll">Element</span> chooses <span class="bluescroll">Blue</span>. Note that level 1 is technically the most efficient for <span class="redscroll">Raw</span>, level 3 is the most efficient for <span class"bluescroll">Element</span>.
Further note that the buffs are opposite to Dereliction, where the scrolls are reversed, making them usually mutually exclusive. 
    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">4b</th>
<td> <span class="bluebg">Furious 3 and Dragon Conversion 3 (Furiosu DC3)</span></td>
<td>Furious 3 gives +20 Resistance in all elements.  DC3, on <span class="bluescroll">Blue Scroll</span> grants +15 Resistance for all elements by hitting for 30 times. Phial ticks count as full hits for this. Swapping to <span class="redscroll">Red Scroll</span> sets all Ele Resists to 0 but converts positive res into element (conversion rate 4:1).
    On its own, this combination can grant up to 43 more element, a massive buff. It’s very comfortable to use, as the DC buff is permanent.
    Note: When going for this, do not use Skill+ when qrafting, as it’s guaranteed to take away some ele res, which hurts your potential damage.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row" rowspan="2">5</th>
<td><span class="bluebg">Burst 3</span></td>
<td>Hitting a monster gives +5 Raw and Element and puts you on a 3s timer. If you hit more during that window, the timer resets and more raw and element gets added, until the cap of +15 raw and +15 ele.
    The real kicker here is the +15 element, which is a lot with all the multipliers elemental Swaxe has going for it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="redbg">Burst 1</span></td>
<td>Unlike Element, for Raw sets, Burst is a 1-point-Wonder. 10 Raw for a single level 2 slot is great, but the extra 5 from the additional 4slot (or 2x 2slot) does not justify the investment. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">6</th>
<td><span class="redbg">Attack Boost 4 or 7 (AB4/7)</span></td>
<td>Nice and simple extra raw. The +% are based off of <u>base</u> raw (weapon attack + slot upgrades + augments). 4, 6 and 7 are the desirable levels, just avoid levels 1-3 and 5, as they’re inefficient for their investment:damage ratio.</td>

<td rowspan="2">Due to the sheer damage EBC provides, we want a way to access it as consistently as possible. Having 3 bugs enables pseudo-chains (i.e. back-to-back with a little delay), while 4 can chain indefinitely for as long as the picked up bug lasts. 
FBL2 will make the generated third bug last until Bloodlust procs again, while FBL3 can make it permanent. Wind Mantle 1 is a cheaper option that does not enable counter-chains but can still help especially with setups that involve Wirestep or Soaring Wyvern Blade.

<tr>
<th scope="row">1</th>
<td>Intrepid Heart 1 (IH1)</td>
<td>IH comes with an extra gauge, which fills up by attacking monsters. Swaxe needs 40 hits to fill it completely - phial ticks count in full, meaning you can activate it pretty fast. Once filled, it’ll stay full until you take a hit that would knock you back or send you flying. This consumes the bar, but negates that knockback and drastically reduces damage taken. It’s a hyper armor on demand skill, which makes Heaven Sent just that much more comfortable. Being on a level 1 slot deco makes it pretty easy to fit, highly recommended.
    Level 2 only adds an explosion that deals 300 damage upon being hit and activating IH, making it a fairly underwhelming “upgrade”.
    </td>

<th scope="row">3</th>
<td>Evade Extender 1 (EE1)</td>
<td>Can help with positioning and getting out of a lot of attacks, but can also land you in a lot of attacks and mess with your positioning. Using it is preference, just avoid going above 1.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">MP</th>
<td>Shockproof 1</td>
<td>Completely useless in singeplayer, flinch free on crack in multiplayer. Can increase your dps massively just on virtue of not being punted around by the next Bullet Barrage spamming random (and other offenders).
    Theoretically, you can adapt your playstyle to not needing either Flinch Free or Shockproof, so don’t worry about not being able to fit it, but it does make positioning and aggression just a little bit easier.

<p><u>Gameplan:</u><br>
Different from normal MoH3 sets, you’ll want to engage first, proc HS and then swap to gain the sharpness restoring effect. If you have more/extra handicraft, you can swap earlier too - just make sure to always be in purple sharp.</p>
<p>HS3 does not require a scroll swap to activate however, and swapping again resets DC bonus, meaning you’ll have to land 30 hits again. It’s important to note that HS will run out if you’re out of range or get sent flying - damage taken does not matter, which is why Intrepid is so strong for this. HS also grants infinite stamina, making Max Might a somewhat reliable source of affinity (for once).
Best used in Arena/Forlorn Arena or with mons that don’t fly/jump/dig away a whole lot.</p>
<p>You’ll play on <span class="bluescroll">Blue Scroll</span>.<br>
