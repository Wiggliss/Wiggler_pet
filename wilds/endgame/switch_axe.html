                    aswell as having reached endgame and general access to the higher tier decoration quests.

                                    <li><u>Second Slot</u>: Caprice Meal (Hi) (Airy Egg) gives +15 Raw in random intervals during its Duration, which last for 10 seconds each.</li>
                                    Alternatively, Tumbler Meal (Mud and Turbid Shrimp) grant additional Iframes on dodges.
                                    <li>Lastly, Moxie Meal (Specialty/Slid Garlic) can prevent one cart.</li>

                                    Ultimately, there is no stand-out absolute banger meal that will make a ginormous impact, so eating whatever is available or cooked by villagers or even just Meat is good enough.</p>

                                    Items consumed in the Hub/”Safe Area” persist into quests. Equipping a set with Mushroomancer and Item Prolonger and then consuming buffing items will increase their duration and make farming for them significantly faster, due to only needing mushrooms and seeds. Whether that is something you want to deal with is up to you.</p>

                                    The current consensus is to either give it a Para Weapon or to leave it at home. Para is the preferred status, as it does not interfere with Agitator, which is taking a more central role in this Meta again.<br>
                                    Cat unlocks extra abilities by doing its Side Quests, namely:
                                    <ul><li>Revive on cart with half health (once/quest)</li>

                                                The Current meta revolves around Artian Weapons.
The Materials to craft the good ones are obtained from HR41+ Tempered Investigations.
The Three materials needed to craft a Switch Axe are 2x Blade and 1x Device.
To craft an Artian Switch Axe, talk to Gemma and select the Forge Artian Weapon option.
Next, Select the parts:
Each part has an Element (or a Status), and either Attack or Affinity associated with it. Using two of the same Element/Status makes the resulting weapon have that Element/Status. For Switch Axe specifically, this also impacts the Phial Type the resulting Weapon will have.
Using the same Element/Status three times boosts the value a bit. It is preferred to use the same Element/Status three times for that reason.
The “Infusions” on these parts always resemble 5. Current Highest Tier Artian Weapons have a base of 190 Raw and 5% Affinity, aswell as 20 Units of White Sharpness and a Dragon Phial. They always have 3-3-3 Slots.
If you, as an example, use 2 Attack Infusions and 1 Affinity Infusion, the resulting weapon will have 190 + (2x5) Attack and 5+(1x5)% Affinity.
The results thus work like this:

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Note that you cannot mix and match Parts of differing Rarity. Rarity 6 and 7 Artian weapons are strictly not worth it.</p>

<p>Proceeding with the currently widely applicable pick of 3x Para, the weapon is crafted with the stats from the Result tab. After crafting comes Reinforcing. This is done via the “Reinforce/Dismantle Artian Weapons” Menu option at Gemma.<br>
Pick the Reinforce option and the Weapon you want to gamble on.</p>

<p>Reinforcement Materials can be obtained by trading with the secondary forge in Azuz. Trade your unneeded Monster Materials and Licenses for Oricalcite. <br>
It takes 10 Oricalcite per roll, for a total of 5 rolls = 50 of those ores.<br>
This is where the weapons are truly made. Each “Reinforcement” adds 1 of 4 possible rolls on the weapon.<br>
These are:<ul>
<li>+5% Affinity;</li> 
<li>+3 Element/Status (bloated to 30);</li> 
<li>+5 Raw; </li>
<li>+30 Units of Sharpness.</li></ul>
Depending on what you are building for, you may want differing rolls. This guide generally recommends going for a total (this includes the parts used to craft the weapon) +60 Sharpness (2 rolls), and the rest into Attack, to end at at least 205-210 Attack, 80 Units of White Sharpness, Power Phial and 8(0) Para.<br>
Gains above 210 Attack are generally not worth chasing, as they become increasingly rarer. As long as you avoid Element Boost, you’ll be fine.</p>

<p>Due to the RNG factor, you’re likely to end up with a trash weapon.
Dismantling an Artian weapon returns the Ore used to Reinforce it back to you. You lose the Parts (2x Blade, 1x Device) used to craft it, but the Ores are one less worry you need to have.</p>

                The following set is your best general bet.<br>
It does NOT assume Might Seed, Demon Powder, Mega/Demon Drug or specific food skills due to how annoying they are to farm. They DO however assume the Power Charm, obtained by doing the Double Ajarakan Arena quest (“As Gatekeeper”) from Rex’ Questline in Suja.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mantles will not be accounted for unless otherwise specified, as they do not reset between quests without the use of third party mods.</p>
<p>Overall,  the current Meta is strongly reminiscent of Iceborne’s Fatalis Meta.

                            <p>Due to the Talisman and Weapon upgrades, aswell as the Artian Weapon Meta, most sets will only fully come online at around HR70-80, depending on grinding strategy and deco/material RNG.</p>
                            <p>Every Non-Level 3 Decoration becomes target meldable at HR 100, meaning you’ll never truly be locked out of a set completely. In situations of extreme strokes of bad luck, you might have to give up 1 level of crit boost, which hurts, but has no hunt-breaking impact given how short lived monsters in Wilds seem to be.</p>
                        <p>For the "high end" sets, the baseline requirement is HR100, because that's when RNG Charms start to become available. Realistically, however, all sets except 1 incorperating them are theoretical, as the drop chances for these charms are so astronmically low, you're unlikely to ever see them legitimately.</p>

    <p><u>Gameplan</u>:<br>
    Full Release Slash.<br>
        This set has an empty 3-Slot, which is ideally used for either Flayer 1 or Adrenaline Rush 1.<br>
        From testing, Adrenaline rush has an uptime of about 13% on average, while Flayer 1 on average deals about 1% of the target monsters' health over the course of a hunt.<br>
        Flayer 1 is the preferred option.<br>
    Please understand that Evade Extender 2 is dangerous to get used to, as it enables bad habits which can limit your ability to use Sets that don't have the space for it in the future.</p>

<p> 
    <u>Requirements</u>:<br>
    <ul><li>Artian Weapon with 0 extra Affinity, aswell as 2 Sharpness Reinforcements, preferably Paralysis status,</li>
    <li>1x <span class="tooltip">Burst<span class="tooltiptext">Chain</span></span>, 1x Flayer, 3x <span class="tooltip">Counterstrike<span class="tooltiptext">Counter</span></span> Armor Decorations,</li>
    <li>Attack Boost 3, Weakness Exploit 1 Charm (rarity 8) OR Attack Boost 3, Burst 1 Charm (rarity 8) OR Attack Boost 3, Flayer 1 Charm (rarity 8)</li>
    <li>1x Crit boost 3 + 1x Crit Boost 2 OR 2x Crit Boost 3 Decoration, and 1x Power Prolonger 3 Decoration</li></ul>
            <p><u>Uptime Assumption</u>:<br>
Uptime Assumptions are: <ul><li> 63% Agitator,</li>
    <li>13% Burst Stage 1, 60% Burst Stage 2,</li>
    <li>65% Latent Power,</li>
    <li>81% Counterstrike,</li>
    <li>81% Maximum Might,</li>
    <li>71% Accuracy for Wex,</li>
    <li>and 88% Guts.</li></ul>
    <br>
    
    <p><u>Gameplan</u>:<br>
    Full Release Slash. Counter Strike procs off of FRS hyper armor and counters, and lasts for 45 Seconds at level 3. Latent Power activates both on a Time Condition (120s in Combat), and a damage taken condition (130 damage taken), allowing for some form of synergy.<br>
    This set also comes with some free 1-Slots, depending on charm, and Evade Extender 2.<br>
    Please understand that Evade Extender 2 is dangerous to get used to, as it enables bad habits which can limit your ability to use Sets that don't have the space for it in the future.</p>
    <p><u>Recommended Comfort</u>: Speed Eating, Shockproof 1 for MP, Weapon Deco: Power Prolonger 3/Handicraft 1 Decoration, Stun/Tremor… Res, Aquatic Mobility 1, Quick Sheathe, Adaptability 1…</p>
            <p>Somehow, a lot of people keep asking for a Weakness Exploit set over Agitator. This set has a higher Average damage than the above listed ones, until either all the Skills are active at which point it outright looses, or if you miss a Wex-zone just once with an FRS. This makes it significantly harder to play for a noticably worse payoff. 
Additionally, it requires one of the above listed very rare charms. Despite that, however, it technically has winning Matchups against Guardian monsters, as their enrage works differently than normal hunts.</p>
    
    
    <p><u>Weapon Alternatives</u>:<br>
        Best in Slot is technically an Artian Weapon with 220 Raw, 5% Affinity and 2 Sharpness (so crafted with 3x Attack of same Status, and only rolling 2x Sharpness and rest Attack).<br>
    <span class="tooltip">Blazing Mahaiah<span class="tooltiptext">Zoh Shia</span></span> has to drop 2 levels of Critical Boost, as Power Prolonger is more impactful, but can beat even a perfect Artian roll, depending on your luck with Whiteflame procs.<br>
    While technically superior on paper, it looses the 1-2 paras per hunt, which in turn means less aggressive <span class="tooltip">FRS<span class="tooltiptext">Full Release Slash</span></span> spam, resulting in Lower DPS, depending on playerskill and about a dozen other factors.<br>
Unlike other sets that could opt for Mind's Eye on hunts such as Gore or Rey, this one cannot, as Mind's eye and Weakness Exploit have directly opposing conditions.

                Full Release Slash. Counter Strike procs off of FRS hyper armor and counters, and lasts for 45 Seconds at level 3.
                This set also comes with a at least 4 1-Slot.<br>
                    It is also exactly what it says on the tin. It's weaker than Latent Power variations in pretty much every instance and has less flexibility for skills such as Flayer, which somehow ended up being the next best thing to slot, but if you do not care about that and just really despise Latent Power, this is the set for you.
                <p><u>Recommended Comfort</u>: Shockproof 1 for MP, Weapon Deco: Power Prolonger 3/Handicraft 1 Decoration, Stun/Tremor… Res, Aquatic Mobility 1, Quick Sheathe, Adaptability 1…</p>

                This Set in particular has a lot of options in terms of extra Skills and comfort slots.<br>
                Upon taking any elemental damage, Convert Element activates and stays active for 120 seconds, after which it cannot activate again for 90 seconds. Dealing (raw) Damage while it is active can proc additional Damage, similar to Scorcher, Whiteflame and Flayer.<br>
                We don't care about the boost to Element it provides; we only care about that proc. It potentially has some winning Matchups, but overall mostly contributes with extra Visual Effects through Element Convert procs, synergizes well with how our counter works and Counterstrike, and offers a lot of freedome to build and experiment otherwise.
                <p><u>Recommended Comfort</u>: Shockproof 1 for MP, Weapon Deco: Power Prolonger 3/Handicraft 1 Decoration, Stun/Tremor… Res, Aquatic Mobility 1, Quick Sheathe, Speed Eating, Adaptability 1…</p>

                    TU2 added Seregios and the long-awaited return of Lagiacrus. Remember Tri?<br>
                    Capcom doesn't seem to, because element was really bad for Switch Axe back then, and Lagi's Swaxe is a Power Phial with a built-in pretty massive increase of element attack, in the form of Convert Thunder Resistance. Ironically, this is a blessing in disguise due to a convoluted modifier that has finally been mathed out around this time, applying exclusively to the flat increases to element Attack. Simplified: Power Phials are now better at element than Element Phials.
                    <p>Tempered Seregios and Lagiacrus both do very well in highlighting the weaknesses of this our weapon, specifically how our entire kit revolves around Hyper Armor. Steve's bleed can quickly become insurmountable if not prepared for, and Lagiacrus' Discharges are multihits that can and will kill us through Hyper Armor if we don't keep our health high.
                <p>Meta-wise, neither of the pieces related to these two have any actual impact and present sidegrades at best. Seregios could have been an upgrade, but unfortunately clashes with our playstyle so much that it quickly becomes an incoherent mess to juggle all the uptime skills with it. Lagiacrus is the de-facto weapon for the Seregios, Mizutsune and Uth Duna Matchups, and has a paper-matchup against Gore Magala, if you only ever hit the head.
                    <p>Additionally, TU2 Later added Arch-Tempered Uth Duna, which had a similar impact to the other two additions, namely: None. Technically speaking, on Sets that opt for Lagiacrus' Swaxe, it was even a pretty noticable downgrade due to the negative Thunder Resistance.
                    <p>(Un)fortunately, the "Downward Adjustments" weren't meant for FRS, which instead got a sizable buff: the travel distance in Focus Mode was greatly increased, making it easier to land after a Focus Strike, further improved by lowering the knockback on Sword Mode's focus strike finisher while holding forward. The Morph after Spiral in the FRS Loop got +8 MV per hit for a total of 16 MV.<br>
                        Bridging Slash, which is the first hit of Triple Slash, also received a buff of 10 MV, making it stronger than the first hit of double slash (which is the second hit of triple slash). The Gap between FRS and other playstyles thus widened even more, in FRS' favour.
                        <p>The last big update was the fixing of the Antivirus' description. Arch-Tempered monsters are no longer on Event Rotation and remain permanently accessible, for now.

                    TU1 added Mizutsune and a rematch with Zoh Shia, which can now also spawn as investigation. Tempered Mizu has a situational Oneshot with an interesting conditional Weapon Skill, which is unfortunately Stuck on an Element Phial, rendering it insultingly weak. Zoh on the other hand boasts about twice as much Health as every other Monster in the game, having just about 50.000 hitpoints. 
                    It's chest piece is a new fan favourite, being an efficency monster if compared to other available armor pieces. It's weapon rivals and arguably beats even min-maxed Artians, depending on dozens of factors of course.</p>
                    <p>
                    Phial Ticks no longer magnetize to hitzone hit, Max Might is now easier to maintain which technically is a nerf to 2p fulgur, largely removing it from the meta landscape.

                    <p>
                    Newly discovered was the ability to Lean by the repeated usage of the Azuz Greeting Gesture. This led to, eventually, players falling through the floor, certain Aerial attacks like Hammers Slide -> Spin and most prominently Sword and Shields backhop followup to proc an unfathomable amount of times - until they inevitably became one with the void. This was relatively quickly patched.</p>
                    <p>
                    Skill descriptions remain largely made up, somehow translating 10% from japanese to 15% in most other languages and certain skills claiming they have activation conditions that they just don't. Additionally, we're happy to report that we collectively learned that there is 2 Stages to being Wet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Arch-Tempered Rey Dau was released and brought us a new Toy: Guts. The (almost) 5% attack it provides makes it not only relevant, but also generally beat every other setbuilding archetype. Rey gamma kept its Rey Dau Setbonus intact, meaning the preferred 3-Piece variant also has longer Latent Power duration, a Skill Swaxe synergizes with very nicely, much to the dismay of many, author included.

                    Switch Axe had really, REALLY pathetic numbers during all three Open Beta Tests. Now, in the <s>Open Beta Test 3</s> Released Game, those numbers were cranked up to 11, and then they cranked 11 up to 50. </p>
                    <p>Full release went from a doinky ~160 MV move for its damage loop to a 506 monster. Rising Slash combo is 123 MV. Absolutely absurd.</p>
                    <p>The performance has increased significantly, and the game was largely rid of any annoying actually functioning systems. Glitches and Bugs to permanently activate certain conditional Skills, like the 4 Piece Jin Dahaad set bonus, Latent power, Agitator and this game's version of Bloodlust are making any set optimization completely moot. Full Sets come with 5 points to 3-point skills, notably Ajarakan Alpha. Luckily, the Beta version of that set drops some skills in order to make room for Slots. Unfortunately, without fail, that skill is never Partbreaker.

    There is a crazy attention to Detail in many instances, but it is evident that none of it went into making half of the new systems work.
On the bright side, they’ve managed to do what many people have desperately hoped for: Element and Raw have different playstyles. Unfortunately, Element has 0 winning match ups, as every good element skill, such as Element Attack and Critical Element compete with Critical Boost, which ultimately means, it doesn’t compete with Critical Boost.</p>
<p>The Crit Meta is finally dead. Long live the crit meta!

            <input id="8.0" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
            <label for="8.0" class="CollHeading"><h3>8. Frequently Asked Questions</h3></label><div class="CollParagraph">
                <p> 
<ul>
<li>Q: Why no Rapid morph?</li>
<li>A: It's a Weapon Deco. While it offers an alternative playstyle, the damage loss and added juggling of Buff States in Amp and Power Axe make it overall not worthwhile for the purposes of optimization.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: Why not Focus?</li>
<li>A: Because it doesn’t really do anything and competes with Crit Boost and Power Prolonger, which means it doesn't.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: Why no element sets?</li>
<li>A: The big issue with it is that phials were a post-modifier and are now a base modifier. So instead of having your full set be scaled by the 45% element provides, it only scales off of the 20-43 you can get at most. Additionally, the ele cap is very low (it scales with the base element of the weap). Due to the resulting smol numbers, some rounding issues come up, which I wasn’t able to replicate in the calculator I built to determine meta sets. Elemental skills like Ele Attack and Crit Ele compete with crit boost, which means that they don’t compete with crit boost. Additionally, all Phial Ticks have an elemod of 0.35 instead of 1, putting them in line with Iceborne rather than Sunbreak.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: Why are there no mantles?</li>
<li>A: Because they don’t reset on Quest Start/End. After the Nerf to it, Corrupted Mantle still offers an Alternative Playstyle with Rising Slash over Full Release, but Evasion is potentially stronger, and Mending some much desired Comfort. It’s hard to justify optimizing around either of them when they could be up from anywhere between every 4th to every other quest.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: Why not Partbreaker, it says it increases Focus Strike damage?</li>
<li>A: It does currently not increase Focus Strike damage. It does, however, increase the 30 or so damage wounds deal when they are broken, by the specified amount in the skills description.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: Why do the sets overcap affinity? Frenzy gives 15% and Antivirus 3 gives 15%!</li>
<li>A: Frenzy gives 15% when cured. Antivirus only gives 10%. The description is wrong. Addendum: In english. Apparently, Japanese text is correctly stating it to be 10%.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How long does Amp last? Why is Power Prolonger 3 good?</li>
<li>A: Base Amp duration is 45 seconds. Power Prolonger 3 doubles this to 90 seconds.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: What does Power Axe do?</li>
<li>A: Only while in Axe Mode, it grants +10 Raw.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How much does Power Charm add?</li>
<li>A: Power Charm grants +6 Raw.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How to make Artian weapons? What’s the best one?</li>
<li>A: Section 2.2.1 covers Artian weapons.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How does the Offset work? Why does it topple so inconsistently?</li>
<li>A: As far we know, Offset operates on a threshold. At the start of the hunt, the threshold is really low, everytime the actual offset happens, the threshold increases. This explains why the offset effect (big shotgun sound effect) appears on your screen, but the actual topple doesn’t happen. You need to reach the threshold everytime. Note that even if you don’t get the topple, you can still follow it up with a Heavy Slam.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How does Scorcher work?</li>
<li>A: Similar to how Status works. It “randomly” (likely pre-determined chance like status, i.e. 10 out of 30 hits; needs testing) procs an extra hit of pure fire damage. That proc does not scale with Attack and doesn’t care about innate weapon element, but scales with Burst, Coalescence and Fire Attack. I go over it a little bit in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4F1w3r6xgc" target="_blank">this video</a> (youtube).</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: What does Frenzy Mantle do?</li>
<li>A: While equipped, it drains health, but procs an additional hit on some combos, depending on Weapon Type. For Switch Axe, the attacks this procs on are:<br>
Axe: Overhead Slash, Side Slash, Spiral Burst Slash, aswell as<br>
Sword: Overhead Slash, Right Rising Slash, Left Rising Slash.<br>
Additionally, while attacking with this mantle equipped, an invisible gauge is filled, likely based on how much MV the attacks have. Once cleared, this mantle also grants +10 Affinity aswell as +5% Raw.</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: How to farm nourishing extract?</li>
<li>A: Double Guardian investigations drop a lot of them. - Pinky</li>
</p>
<p>
<li>Q: What does Gore 4 Piece bonus do?</li>
<li>A: 2P will infect you with frenzy while fighting monsters. 4P will additionally grant 10 Raw while infected, which becomes 15 Raw (total!) after clearing it.</li>
<li>Q: Why does the guide not get updated faster/every game update/so slowly?</li>
    <li>A: Not all updates are equal. Title update 2, up until the RNG Charm Update, did nothing for Swaxe. Since comfortability of a given Set is not the focus here, and listing every possible side-grade would consist of a couple hundred Sets that all require playtesting and intensive mathing, ontop of hindering readability, it is generally not done. Rest assured that as soon as a quantifiable update to the provided Sets or Playstyles are found, it will be updated - for Switch Axe, usually within the week of the update.</li>
