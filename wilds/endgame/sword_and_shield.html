Math was done by BK and Mopop independently and then cross-checked, sets were optimized using Armor Set Search.
                </p>
                <p>
For the sets, please find attached BK’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGko0sy5IIDyLJvCcIo3diQbv4AKZ5LSvOfsG21dKsM/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">math sheet</a> (Google Sheets). It contains frame data for most of the relevant SnS DPS rotations, DPS analysis, build recommendations, matchup calculations, etc. The math sheet has been tested in the field to ensure that the damage formulae used results in the actual damage numbers seen in-game. For more details on how this is done, please refer to the sheet.
                </p>
                <p>
Set recommendations are based on Lateral Combo > Spinning Reaper > Amped Charged Chop DPS, as well as sustained loop (e.g. Lateral Loop, Chop Combo) DPS to a certain extent.

                            <p>
The first thing to know about the new charms is that the vast majority of them are not worth running over even your basic WEX2/Agi2 charms at this point:<br>
Current skill budget on HR armor is low, meaning that taking away armor skill points and exchanging them for weapon skill points turns out to be a bad trade right now.<br>
You’ll need a god charm (literally perfect) to beat out current WEX2/Agi2 charms. Even then, the overall gain is minimal, about ~0.3% over the existing standard. That’s about 2 seconds saved in a 10 minute fight.<br>
Again, if you do not roll literally perfect, you’re losing out on damage compared to the regular builds.<br>
The odds of rolling perfect are absolutely abysmal (1/192,000).
                            </p>
                            <p>
The god charms are the below or equivalent:<br>
[Attack Boost 3 / Weakness Exploit 1 OR Burst 1 OR Agitator 1] with at least 1 weapon deco slot<br>
[Offensive Guard 3 / Weakness Exploit 1 OR Burst 1 OR Agitator 1] with at least 1 weapon deco slot<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
These charms will be equal in many cases but OFG charms will typically be the most flexible option.
                            </p>
Conclusion: Don’t sweat over the charm grind for now, the improvements are negligible at this moment. This may change as we get more armor skill budget, however!

        2.3.1 Uptime Assumptions</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p>
A very important caveat about uptime assumptions is that different people have different uptimes for different skills. This depends on the player’s skill level and the monster matchup. The best way to get uptimes that are relevant to you, would be to measure the uptime yourself. This can be done via video analysis (tedious), or via mods. 
            </p>
            <p>
The uptimes we cite here are based on generally good gameplay (e.g. huge focus on hitting weakspots, not getting hit too often, and using good combos). Speedrunners may have better uptimes, and new players may have worse. Because as set builders, we have to make assumptions and generalisations about skill level and monster matchups, these numbers are really just averages, and you may find that your own uptime for a particular monster differs significantly. Hence, if you want the actual uptime, measure it yourself.

<li>Frenzy Heal: 70%</li>
<li class="indent">Assumed 70% uptime for good play.</li>
<li class="indent">Antivirus reduces the threshold to overcome the Frenzy Virus by 30%, added to that the weapon motion values have been increased across the board when compared to Sunbreak.</li>
<li class="indent">Please see section 2.3.5 Frenzy for more detailed discussion on how this skill now works.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Coalescence: 37.5%</li>
<li class="indent">Because we assume you get one cure on average every 80s, and Coalescence lasts for 30s, the uptime is 37.5%.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Maximum Might: 80% on normal sets, practically 100% on Second Wind sets.</li>
<li class="indent">Accounts for PG stamina depletion as well as rolls, backsteps, etc.</li>
<li class="indent">Note that Maximum Might now has a “grace period” where you have to spend 2s below maximum stamina before it deactivates.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Burst:</li>
<li class="indent">First hit bonus: 100% (practically always on)</li>
<li class="indent">5th hit bonus: 70% (analysed from the uptime mod back in Sunbreak)</li>
<li class="indent">Because the way this skill activates and upgrades mid combat has not changed from Sunbreak, we don’t expect this value to change for Wilds.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Agitator: 70%</li>
<li class="indent">Unlike Sunbreak, monsters don’t have a forced cooldown period making this skill viable once again.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Offensive Guard: 40%</li></ul>
<li class="indent">Based on video analysis of speedruns and casual runs in Wilds.</li>
<li class="indent">In particularly good matchups, the uptime may increase to 50%. This however does not make the skill better than Critical Boost or Master’s Touch.</li></ul>

        2.3.2 Sharpness Management</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p> 
SnS has no innate sharpness mitigation beyond using Shield attacks, and spends around 120 - 150 sharpness in 3 - 4 minutes, which is around the time a monster will change area.
            </p>
            <p>
Hence, sharpness management is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
For this guide, we will recommend Master’s Touch in general given that most of the sets have good affinity.
Razor Sharp + Handicraft is slightly inferior but will still work if you don’t have the Master’s Touch deco.
            </p>
            <p>

        2.3.5 Frenzy</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p> 
Frenzy activates at an MV threshold, but this threshold increases over the course of the hunt based on how many times you’ve already triggered Frenzy cure. My rough estimates are 450/550/650/750/850 (cap) MV. Of course, this could be wrong, and I’ll correct it as new information comes in, but for now this is my best guess as to how this skill works in Wilds.
            </p>
            <p>
A couple of things to note:
<ul><li>Our MVs in Wilds are slightly higher than in Sunbreak (15 - 20% higher)</li>
<li>Hunts now are quite short as monsters don’t have a lot of HP.</li>
<li>Antivirus 3 reduces the MV threshold to cure by 30%</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
The uptime from Sunbreak was 30s pre-cure, 60s post-cure on average across a hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
Because in Wilds we now have Antivirus and increased MVs, we can calculate a new theoretical uptime:
<ul><li>30s x 0.7 x 0.85 = 17s</li>
<li>17s down and 60s up is about 78% uptime.</li></ul>
For the uptime, we will use a slightly more conservative (and nicer to work with) estimate of 70%.

<li>Falling Bash (Plunging Thrust still procs Flayer/Whiteflame Torrent)</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
Whiteflame Torrent works as follows:
<li><ul>The game assigns a random number of “checks” at the start, between 1 and 3.</li>
<li>Attacking a monster removes a check and starts an internal cooldown of ~3s on removing further checks.</li>
<li>Once all checks are removed, Whiteflame Torrent activates and deals a flat 50 damage to the monster. The game generates a new “random number” for checks</li></ul>
This check system simulates a 33% chance to activate.
            </p>
            <p>
Scorcher alters the damage of Whiteflame Torrent..
At base, Scorcher activates similarly to Whiteflame Torrent. 
<li><ul>Scorcher 1 w/ no Whiteflame Torrent</li>
<li class="indent">1 ele mod off 400 (post-bloat removal 40) Fire</li></ul>
<li><ul>Scorcher 2 w/ no Whiteflame Torrent</li>
<li class="indent">1 ele mod off 1000 (post-bloat removal 100) Fire</li></ul>
<li><ul>Scorcher 0 + Whiteflame:</li>
<li class="indent">50 flat</li></ul>
<li><ul>Scorcher 1 + Whiteflame:
<li class="indent">60 flat + 1 ele mod off 300 (post-bloat removal 30) Fire</li></ul>
<li><ul>Scorcher 2 + Whiteflame:</li>
<li class="indent">80 flat + 1 ele mod off 800 (post-bloat removal 80) Fire</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
Because SnS can hit fast, we can typically remove checks every 3 - 4s when we’re doing our sustained damage rotations.
            </p>
            <p>
We can assume the average time to remove a check is 3.5s for good play.<br>
Hence:
<ui><li>Whiteflame 1 check time taken: 3.5s</li>
<li class="indent">Whiteflame 2 checks time taken: 7s</li>
<li class="indent">Whiteflame 3 checks time taken: 10.5s</li></ul>
Average whiteflame proc time taken: 7s.<br>
Hence, we deal about 50 more damage every 7 seconds, give and take. This increases DPS by 7.14
            </p>
            <p>
For Scorcher 1 + Whiteflame on an average 20 eHZV:
<ul><li class="indent">60 flat + (20/100) * (30) * 1 = 66 damage
<li class="indent">66 damage every 7 seconds = 9.42 DPS increase</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
For Scorcher 2 + Whiteflame on an average 20 eHZV
<ul><li class="indent">80 flat + (20/100) * (80) * 1 = 96 damage</li>
<li class="indent">96 damage every 7 seconds = 13.71 DPS increase</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
We know our theoretical DPS on monsters already.<br>
Let’s assume Rey Dau hitzones (60:20) and we’re using our sustained damage combo Lateral Loop.<br>
On a typical Verdoloto Ice build, we get 179 theoretical DPS on Lateral Combo > SR > CC2, and 160 theoretical DPS on lateral slash > Return Stroke > Roundslash looped.
            </p>
            <p>
7 more damage per average of 10.5s in this case would be about:
<ul><li class="indent">3.9% damage more on Lateral Combo > SR > CC2</li>
<li class="indent">4.3% damage more on Lateral Loop.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
However, these DPS numbers are theoretical and most of the time your actual DPS is going to be far lower due to downtime, getting hit, etc.<br>
The nice thing about the internal cooldown of Whiteflame is that it doesn’t matter what you do in those 3 seconds or so. You could be not attacking and Whiteflame will still operate as per usual. Hence, the actual DPS contribution of Whiteflame is going to be similar regardless of your actual damage output, unless you’re doing something wrong (aka not hitting the monster once every 3 seconds for the majority of the fight).
            </p>
            <p>
Let’s take 3* Tempered Arkveld with around 24K HP. If you kill Tempered Arkveld in 5 minutes, you’re dealing about 80 DPS, and if you kill Tempered Arkveld in 7.5 minutes, you’re dealing about 53.3 DPS.<br>
If we assume that Whiteflame’s DPS +7.14 remains similar regardless of your actual damage output (barring extreme cases), then:
<ul><li>5 min T. Arkveld:</li>
<li class="indent">Whiteflame Torrent: +8.9% damage increase</li>
<li class="indent">Whiteflame Torrent + Scorcher 1: +11.8%</li>
<li class="indent">Whiteflame Torrent + Scorcher 2: +17.1%</li>
<li>7.5 min T. Arkveld: +13.4% damage increase</li>
<li>Whiteflame Torrent + Scorcher 1: +17.7%</li>
<li>Whiteflame Torrent + Scorcher 2:: +25.7%</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
Whiteflame Torrent is actually pretty powerful, and Scorcher is pretty good when paired with Whiteflame as well.<br>
Whiteflame Torrent becomes more powerful the less damage you deal, because across a range of DPS, it will contribute similarly.
            </p>
            <p>
Of course, the caveats of these calculations would be:
<ul><li>You hit the monster once every 3 seconds. If you play well, this is quite doable. If you get hit infrequently, it doesn’t affect the math too much. If you get hit a lot and need to heal a lot, it does start to affect Whiteflame uptime, but generally you’ll still benefit from this skill.</li>
<li>You use certain types of rotations. Generally, because SnS uses a lot of attacks that proc Whiteflame and does many of those attacks across a span of time, it does not have a lot of issues getting 1 check done every 3 seconds generally. However, if you’re a Perfect Rush enjoyer, you may find that your Whiteflame Torrent damage is lacking.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
But overall, Whiteflame is a good skill.

        2.3.7 Convert Element</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p>
Convert Element triggers when you get hit by enough elemental attacks (varies from matchup to matchup?). Notably, Guard and Perfect Guard still count as getting hit for Convert Element to proc.
            </p>
            <p>
Once it procs, for 2 minutes, you gain the following effects:
<ul><li>If your weapon is Dragon element, gain +8/12/18 element (post-bloat removal)</li>
<li class="indent">If your weapon is elemental (i.e. not raw/status), deal 150/200/280 flat damage + 1 ele mod off 60/80/100 Dragon element every so often.</li></ul>
After the 2 minute effect, it goes on cooldown for 1.5 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
The first part of the effect is not very significant, especially considering that the SnS is a raw-centred weapon (most of our damage comes from raw damage [85 - 90%], even for pre-nerf Corrupted Mantle loops where the elemental damage only topped out at 15 - 20% of our damage).
            </p>
            <p>
The second part of the effect is the notable part of the skill.
It seems to build up as a status, meaning that it gets exponentially harder to proc the explosion the more times you have already triggered the explosion.
            </p>
The status buildup per hit seems to be proportional to:
<ul><li>The raw of your weapon</li>
<li>The critical damage multiplier (if your hits crit)</li>
<li>MV of the hit</li>
<li>Convert Element level modifier (1.1/1.15/1.2 from levels 1 - 3)</li></ul>

It does not seem to scale off:
<ul><li>Monster hitzones</li>
<li>Element damage that you deal</li>
<li>Sharpness damage modifier</li></ul>
            <p>
Because Kiranico status numbers are inaccurate for quests and we don’t have a robomeche equivalent resource for status like we do in Rise and World, it is extremely difficult to quantify the general contribution of Convert Element across monsters and across sets. The main way to test Convert Element’s contribution would be to bring in a damage overlay mod to a specific hunt, but you would get results that only apply to that specific hunt, and to the way you played in that hunt. 
            </p>
            <p>
Until we get actual status numbers, we will only provide Convert Element sample sets and describe the damage differential between these sets and the general sets, as well as how many procs you need for the Convert Element sets to beat out the regular sets.

        2.3.8. Bladescale Honing and Razor’s Edge</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p> 
Bladescale Honing is a new skill introduced in TU2. It is present on Seregios weapons. 
It shares the same activation requirement as Adrenaline Rush (it activates on a successful roll/backhop through an attack, but not on Sliding Swipe). 
            </p>
            <p>
Once activated, it provides 6 units of what we call “Seregios sharpness”. 
<ul><li>This sharpness is a slightly better version of purple sharpness, with 1.4x raw multiplier (as opposed to 1.39x for purple) and 1.25x elemental multiplier (although for Seregios weapons, they don’t have element).</li>
<li class="indent">This multiplier applies regardless of the weapon’s underlying current sharpness (e.g. if you’re at green and gain Seregios sharpness, you still get the same 1.4x raw multiplier).</li>
<li>These 6 units of sharpness cannot be extended via Razor Sharp or Master’s Touch.</li>
<li>Attacks which burn less or 0 sharpness (e.g. shield attacks, Plunging Thrust, Charged Chop follow-up hits) will continue to burn the same amount of sharpness, so you could theoretically extend these 6 units of sharpness across more than 6 hits.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
Unfortunately, for SnS, 6 units of sharpness is too little for practical use, considering how fast we burn through sharpness in general. The gain from 1.32x (white) to 1.4x is about 6% increase in damage, meaning that when you have Seregios sharpness, the Seregios weapon goes from 220 base raw to effectively 233 base raw. That’s still not wholly competitive, especially when we take into account the weapon’s poor white sharpness count. 
            </p>
            <p>
Razor’s Edge is the Seregios set skill.
<ul><li>Level 1: extends Adrenaline Rush duration from 30s to 45s, and extends Arush by another 15s if triggered while active (normally, unlike other skills, Adrenaline Rush does not refresh itself if procced while it is active)</li>
<li>Level 2: adds a 5% display raw buff while ARush is active</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
This skill is not strong enough to justify using Seregios armor over Rey Dau armor. The predominant SnS playstyle currently also does not have many chances to activate Adrenaline Rush, because Perfect Guards and Sliding Swipes are preferred over Rolls and Backhops to maintain Maximum Might.
            </p>

         2.3.9. Convert Thunder Resistance and Azure Bolt</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p> 
Convert Thunder Resistance is the Lagiacrus SnS weapon skill. It grants bonus display thunder element to the weapon equal to 40% of your armor’s Thunder Resistance. For the current meta set (3pc Rey), which has 23 Thunder Resistance, that would be equal to 5.75 thunder ele (multiply by 10 to account for in-game element bloat).
            </p>
            <p>
Azure Bolt is a skill that works very similarly to Flayer/Whiteflame Torrent. It has an internal cooldown (likely 3 seconds, similarly to Flayer/Whiteflame). 
You need to accumulate about 100MV damage and the hit after the 100MV triggers the explosive damage (ignore hitzones and your raw)
Once you accumulate enough MV damage, the skill procs:
<ul><li>Level 1:</li>
<li class="indent">Explodes for 30 flat + 70 * thunder HZV/100</li>
<li class="indent">Starts an affinity bonus of 15% affinity for 20 seconds</li>
<li class="indent">After the affinity bonus ends, goes on cooldown for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Level 2:</li>
<li class="indent">Explodes for 60 flat + 200 * thunder HZV/100</li>
<li class="indent">Starts an affinity bonus of 15% affinity for 30 seconds</li>
<li class="indent">After the affinity bonus ends, goes on cooldown for 30 seconds</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
If we want to calculate a theoretical uptime for Azure Bolt, it’s not too difficult. 
This is as the uptime of Azure Bolt is mostly fixed within a certain range and the time taken to activate it doesn’t change the uptime of Azure Bolt too much.
            </p>
            <p>
We assume from Frenzy activation (600MV in 30 seconds, can be done faster) that you clock about 120MV in 6 seconds, or 20MV/s.
We know that there is an internal cooldown so if you take 6 procs to activate Azure Bolt that pulls up activation uptime to 20s. Based on some testing, Azure Bolt typically activates much faster, so let’s say 20s is an edge case. 
If you’re fast and lucky (maybe you land some hard hitting attacks and proc it within say 2 procs), then you could potentially proc it in 6s or so.
            </p>
            <p>
So, to calculate uptime for the two edge case above:
<ul><li>For the unlucky edge case: 20s up / (30 down + 20 up + 20 activate) = 28% uptime</li>
<li>For the lucky edge case: 20s up / (30 down + 20 up + 6 activate) = 35% uptime</li></ul>
Generally if we say it takes about 10s to activate, then it’s about 30 - 33%.<br>
Hence, you can see that the uptime generally ranges from 28 - 35%, even taking into account large differences in activation time.<br>
This range is negligible in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
For calculations, I think it’s quite safe to assume 30% uptime.<br>
That’s about 4.5% effective affinity for the 2pc set. In contrast, Gore 2pc gives 25% * 0.7 = 17.5% effective affinity for the 2pc. We can see that the effective affinity bonus for Azure Bolt is actually quite small.
            </p>
            <p>
As for the damage contribution of the explosion, it’s about 45 flat damage per 60s or so. That’s 45/60 = 0.75 DPS bonus. Compared to Whiteflame, which can contribute upwards of 10+ bonus DPS, Azure Bolt’s DPS bonus is mostly negligible. In calculations, we add about a 1% bonus damage multiplier to account for Azure Bolt’s impact on DPS, because the typical good player will hit around 60 DPS (based on experience with DPS tracker mods in game).

Dark arts:
This is a 2 Piece armor set bonus skill for the Normal Omega armor (It’s Bale!) This skill works as follow<br>
When you have Red HP, Increase element by x1.25 Unlike Strife in sunbreak where it's based on the amount of red hp this is fixed. We can’t exactly use this skill due to us having like no way to get resentment reliability at all.<br>
Greatsword players will probably like this.
            </p>
            <p>
as for omega resonance:<br>
This is a 2/4 Piece armor set bonus skill for the Savage Omega armor (not Bale!) The skill works as follows<br>
effects initialize but do not apply in solo<br>
works when someone joins, deactivates when they leave<br>
10/20 Raw for far<br>
20/40 affinity for close<br>
randomly chosen effect at start of hunt, alternates every 90s based on quest timer.
            </p>
            <p>
So like calculation wise the uptime of both of these skills are “50%” assuming you are multi with other people and they don't ruin your quests to stack or not to stack. We could make an optimization for multiplayer based builds but for general sake and the reliance of a teammate make this really unappealing. (You lose dps skills 2)<br>

        3.1.1 Artian Weapons</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p>
The current meta revolves around Artian Weapons for almost all cases (Raw/Status and Element).<br>
You should make an Artian weapon for each element.<br>
For the Artian raw weapons, even though they have less status than the craftable weapons, they still outperform the craftables overall. All the statuses are fine to use. Blast and Poison are very similar in output.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The current recommendation for crafting is:
<ul><li>Blade/Tube/Disc of the same element/status and all three with Attack Infusion</li>
<li><b>Reinforce with <u>3 Raw/ 2 Sharp</u>.</b> 4 Raw/1 Sharp will be slightly stronger (&#60;1%) but will be slightly less comfy to use now due to inflated monster HP that is significantly higher.</li></ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                Something to take note of is that Artian element weapons outperform all craftables even before reinforcement. Of course, you still want minimally 1 sharpness augment to boost the white sharpness from 20 to 50, because 20 sharpness is almost unusable, but don’t worry too much that your weapon is 3 Ele/1Affinity/1Sharpness or some other result, because they’ll still be stronger than the craftables:
<ul><li>At max roll (4 Raw/ 1 Sharp), they outperform by 5-10% depending on element.</li>
<li>At minimum roll, they may be equivalent or outperform by 3 - 5% depending on element.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>You only really need to chase the max roll if you’re a speedrunner aiming for a record, and even then, you will probably want to perform the calculations yourself on which roll is most suitable for your script.

                The current recommendation for weapon decorations is:
            <ul><li>Critical Boost 3</li>
            <li>Offensive Guard 3 / Ele Attack 1 (for element) OR Handicraft 1 (for raw/status)</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, Artian element weapons with the below sets basically outperform the Artian raw weapons on everything except for the most raw-skewed matchups (e.g. Arkveld’s 0EHZV chainblades). Even then, element weapons lose less than 1% compared to raw weapons. We would recommend element weapons in basically all cases.

                <b>Zoh Shia</b>’s weapon performs very similarly to the Artian Dragon weapon with god rolls (4 Attack/1 Sharpness). The Verdoloto will edge out Blazing Mikal slightly for speedrunners, while for casual players (e.g. 8min+ for Tempered Arkveld 3*), the Blazing Mikal will start to perform better.<br>
For <b>combos to use to proc Whiteflame</b>, as long as you’re not spamming Perfect Rush on repeat, you’ll be fine. Because of how Whiteflame works, it only checks every 3s for a valid attack. Most of our normal attacks proc Whiteflame, so there’s basically no issue with triggering Whiteflame. You should still use Spinning Reaper and Charged Chop as per usual. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For Zoh Shia, the two decorations recommended are:
                <ul><li>Master’s Touch</li>
                <li>Critical Boost 3 (you get slightly more damage with Critical Boost 3 than Offensive Guard 3/Dragon Attack 1)</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Lagiacrus</b>’s weapon performs very similarly to the Artian Thunder weapon with god rolls (4 Attack/1 Sharpness). It is slightly weaker (3-4%) compared to the Artian Thunder weapon, and will come very close (1% weaker) on very elemental-skewed matchups (e.g. 40:20 raw:ele ratios). These numbers are calculated using a Thunder element resistance of 23 (from 3pc AT Rey Dau + Zoh Shia Chest + Lagiacrus Boots), for the Convert Thunder Resistance skill of the Lagiacrus weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Lagiacrus, the two decorations recommended are:
<ul><li>Master’s Touch</li>
<li>Critical Boost 3 (you get slightly more damage with Critical Boost 3 than Offensive Guard 3/Thunder Attack 1)</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            The current raw recommendations are:
            <ul><li>Blast: Ajara-Subinda</li>
            <li>Poison: Queen Rapier</li>
            <li>Paralysis: Lala Acanthopelm</li></ul>
            Between the two, Ajara-Subinda slightly edges out Queen Rapier on Tempered Arkveld. You should consider if the monster is poison-weak or blast-weak if you’re bringing it to other matchups.

<p>
The overall conclusion was that crit builds outperformed non-crit builds, and that giving up WEX to slot in more Burst was also not optimal for damage. This was because of Crit Boost still being a very strong overall option in the weapon deco slot.
</p>
<p>
All sets use Maximum Might, Wilds changed how the skill works granting a small grace period where the skill won’t be deactivated even after performing a roll or consuming a small amount of stamina, on top of that most sets have open Lv2 Slots and there isn’t a lot of competition for those slots, all of this results in Maximum Might being a strong choice for all sets, see the related gameplay guide for more information on how to use Maximum 
Might effectively.
</p>
<p>
We took a look at Burst Boost as of the Aug 13 update, but it was still not worth it over the typical best set.
</p>
<p>
<h2>ANNOUNCEMENT: Errata hells</h2>
(TU 3.5 Update) AT Nu Udra forces its way into the meta by providing us an easy way to fit Counterstrike 3. Counterstrike 3 grants a massive +25 raw for 45s when you get hit by an attack that knocks you back (not counting when you block). Since SnS doesn’t have an offset attack, you will take some damage when proccing Counterstrike. The new meta sets mainly trade the inconsistent points of Latent Power (1-3) for Counterstrike 3. The potential damage gained is 1-8% depending on Counterstrike uptime. - HungryDave

<p>
so uh turns out now theres this damn 2P lagi build now which solve all the aforementioned fringe case of LP affinity issues. so uh lmao enjoy
</p>
<p>
and yes i have to Errata so many damn things. you better enjoy seeing me suffer from errataing so much for this 
also thanks to all of you who submitted me the resentment build it was a bait anyways to see what you guys are coming up with the meme/Anti AT Nu builds (Dont get that much hope up on the latter though). -PokerDew

                This thing basically ruined all the whole point of the 2lagi set and the generic 3AT mons set in one fell swoop if for whatever reason. GG capcom you make me agitated even more so somehow 
Hey so uh another more errata a bit, You drop 1 2 flex slots for like more average crits all around, this build is only worse than the main one by the no latent power.<br>
MT charm is technically the best for us im just lazy to include because OFG3 charms are much much more common than MT

This build is for monsters with relevant Mind’s Eye hitzones (≤44 hzv), namely Gore Magala and Lagiacrus. The breakpoint for this build to beat the standard builds happens when about 10-20% of your hits land on Mind’s Eye hitzones. This means that if you hit Wex hitzones (≥45hzv) less than 80% of the time, then this build can beat other meta builds. Gore Magala and Lagiacrus especially have many hitzones where you will end up hitting due to how they behave during the fight.

                    For Arkveld you might feel inclined to use Raw over Dragon (Arkveld chains when charged up are weak to Dragon), in case you use Raw you can opt for Poison/Blast or Paralysis.<br>
                    Our damage is still mostly on the raw part, Artian stats are basically the same and adding extra dmg from ele is nice, especially in some matchups where it's extra weak.

    The Wide-Range build has improved yet again! This time adding Counterstrike 3 without losing damage skills. With Counterstrike 3, you gain +25 raw for 45s when you get knocked back by an attack. With speed eating you can heal quickly and get right back into action with a significant raw buff.

I did say there is nothing changing with the meta, not alternative (also yes wide range somehow moved up to alt now not meme) lol. Anyways, Omega requires a new way of making wide range sets and people seemingly can’t read and find the not godcharm edition so I decided to just compromise for this instead. Omega forelegs are Mind eye’s able and backlegs+Head are WEX, Flayer 1 is there to make wounds faster for the Pantokrator phase.

<p>
BUT The survivability and the support you can do is quite there, although i do have to say whenever it does the Mustard Bomb, PLEASE move away so it doesn’t corner or block people.
Pick up the shield gen whenever the partbreaks (cant slinger grab it btw have to unsheathe pick up by hand) 
OR when it does the laser on its face, Focus strike it.  Lastly, whenever the face has wounds.
When it slams repeatedly in Pantokrator phase after the 3 slams the legs are focus strikeable for a free topple.
Larboard is on the left side of Omega face, vice versa. In Savage after Phase 2 Jin zone it’ll be 360deg now.

MRV Missile if you don’t have shield just sheathe and run there's no point in guarding unless you are lance.<br>
Damage isn’t really the concern on winning against Omega, its survivability.<br>

<p class="fire">This set is meant to be very optimized for killing AT Uth Duna only so don’t use this as a general set!
(maybe you can use it on other thunder weak matchups that isn't Mizu)</p>
<p>Anyways, The set made to maximize the amount of thunder ele you can squeeze from Convert thunder res.
and ignore any comfort options that aren't deemed optimal for AT Uth duna. Don't forget to eat village food for maximum thunder res! Earplugs 2 is enough for AT Uth Duna roars so the empty 2 slot can be CS or EW.
Azure Bolt damage is still negligible, but contributes more to the hunts due to thunder weak matchups now.</p>

<p><b>Now for a quick FAQ and rundown on the fight itself.</b>
The gameplan will mostly be Chop combos -> Spinning Reaper -> Charge chop on forearms, PR finisher is plunging thrust as Uth head hitboxes are small and the body hitboxes are very big. Lateral combos are still used when it doesn’t move around. Expect to do a shorter burst of combos because she will keep moving alright.
<ul><li>Q1: What about the water waves?  A: Go diagonal, Ride the waves towards Uth duna. and always prepare for a followup.</li>
<li>Q2: Where to hit AT Uth duna? A: Try to hit all limbs from the sides. They are good hitzones and have guaranteed tempered wounds too.</li>
<li>Q3: What to do with the long aerial jumping slam? A: <a href="https://streamable.com/d5qrso" target="_blank">Here</a> are the hurtboxes of the moves (streamable, opens in new tab). It's uh pretty big you just try to dodge the 1st and backhop or sliding swipe the 2nd slam as the AoE is only 8 frames (@60fps).
flashing works but for 3 times before she is just completely immune to it.</li>
<li>Q4: Are there any good run examples to use of? A: <a href="https://youtu.be/tgxcAh4eqSw" target="_blank">Here</a> are my very casual hunts on it (youtube, opens in new tab), and <a href="https://youtu.be/EuqO-wNU3OM" target="_blank">here</a> is BotanAnne speedrun (youtube, opens in new tab). Try watching both and don’t trash my gameplay that much. I never advertise myself as a very good hunter to begin with! -PokerDew</li></ul>

                    Thank you to Pilgrim from the Team leviathan who graciously gave us this builder again to actually display these builds in its full glory as both gamecat and wilds builder hub don’t have a way to display these new armor yet 
and if you don’t have godcharm just use normal Wide Range 5. For His project Math hunter isn’t done yet but it’s getting there, eventually the website will be open for public use soon.

                    Ok funny shit I wasn’t going to make this but lmao I had to do it to em anyways so uh the skill itself is explained in section 2.3.10. But It could be good uh ish? The reason why Wide range is here is simply due to Idk what else to put on and you have 3(4) Free lvl 1 slots to do whatever you want, have fun!<br>
<s>I will eventually return mizu set later im lazy to make the docs longer as is</s><br>
(The real reason Wide range is here is simply due to usually the skill cycle every 90 sec quest timer based and losing +10 Raw would be kinda bad and you can’t Unstack yourself anyways might as well just take wide range and eat might seed to get it fixed)

                <p>
                    For every ore you mined depends on rarity you’ll get 10/20/30 raw for 1min 30 sec after you picked up the ore.<br>
                    It is refreshable by very ore you picked up maximum up to 180 -> 270 raw (Will reset when swap weapon or duration ran out)<br>
                    the gameplan now have two plans the Regional one and the moving around region one (Maps)
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Non Region one] just speedrun mine and get as much raw as possible and rush to the monster and do as much dmg as possible in the window,  THEN ACTUALLY USE WEAPON SWAP to your normal raw SnS lmao.assuming you moved between regions. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Region one] If not there is a funny strat where you pre mine for the +90 Raw right away and do the quest in the same region and try to upkeep the uptime as warping camp dont reset it, it just works.

<ul><li>Unfortunately all of the gear/armor are suboptimal compared to the normal AT armor set but we’ll still give a rundown. (When layered you do look really nice though)
True Omega sword have a gimmick where if you perfect guard, you get +30 defense for 30 seconds
This is truly one of the skills of all time (Just layer it for invis weapon the stats are kinda bad)
<li class="indent">If you wanna know how awful this is it's like:<br>
On average you’ll sit at around  400 defense. Your dmg reduction is 83.3% with the +30 will be 430 defense or 84.3% its 1% improvement to the dmg reduction%. 1-(80/80+def) is the formula.  ITS BASICALLY DEFENSE BOOST 3 BUT CONDITIONAL.</li>
<li class="indent">By the way, the enhanced one (With Omega 4P) is +45 Def and lasts for 45 seconds instead now wow!!!</li>
<li>Bale armorset is designed for Dark Knight Greatsword It isn't meant for SnS to be used at all as its skills are uh not what we wanted in the slightest. (Again, just layer lmao)</li>
<li>Omega armor is a bit weird, it's like an alternative AT armor efficiency wise, <s>but no guts bonus for seemingly no reason other than status quo in upgrades. capcom cooked this update for this fr fr. (LAYERRRRRS)</s> Erm Errata a bit. IT IS an upgrade if you consider future armors.</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
<ul><li>AT Nu Udra has shaken up the meta a bit by somehow manage to make us fit in Counterstrike now</li>
<li>This really set us in a bit of a pickle right now due to us lacking any sort of better offensive skills to go by.</li>

                <p>
<ul><li>3pc AT Rey Dau is still the best framework. It gets a minor update from TU1.5, where we now swap out Mizutsune boots for Lagiacrus boots (so Rey/Zoh/Rey/Rey/Lagi)</li>
<li>3pc AT Rey Dau can also be used with 2pc Lagicrus (Rey/Rey/Rey/Lagi/Lagi). This set is almost as good as the set above, but comes with an extra 2 slots. If you get hit a lot, you can slot in Counterstrike. You could also slot in Evade Window.</li>
<li>4pc Lagi is no good. 2pc Lagi/2pc Gore is not as good for us as using AT Rey Dau stuff.</li>
<li>Seregios and Adrenaline Rush are not the best way for us to play (we don’t really want to roll/backhop as much as in previous games), but there is an alternative set presented with Evade Mantle if you’re interested in that.</li>
<li>The Lagiacrus SnS is almost as good as a god-rolled Artian SnS (Lagi is about 3-4% weaker).</li>
<li>The Seregios SnS is not really that good. We burn too much sharpness for the mechanic to be very helpful for us, and the weapon stats aren’t good enough.</li>
<li>In terms of moveset changes:</li>
<li class="indent">Counter Slash nerf (60 -> 50MV) is a blow to Counter Slash, but it still remains a strong response.</li>
<li class="indent">Chop (19 -> 18 MV) and Side Slash (18 -> 17 MV) nerfs are barely noticeable. In the first place, we do not recommend spamming Chop combo other than to reposition, because Lateral combo attacks are quite a bit stronger. These nerfs do not change much.</li>
<li class="indent">Perfect Rush 2 (55 -> 60MV) and Perfect Rush-enhanced Scaling Slash follow-up hits (3 hits of 20 -> 34MV) buffs are huge and push PR into being our best combo. Before you doompost about how we’re going back to Iceborne PR spam, Iceborne’s PR damage is frontloaded, while Rise and Wilds’ PR damage is backloaded. This means that you should not spam PR and only use it when you can definitely hit the entire combo without being interrupted or without missing, because most of the damage is at the back of the PR now.</li>
<li class="indent">Shield combo attacks have each been buffed by 3MV and the first and third attack’s stun value have been increased by 5. These are not big changes, and do not change the use of Shield combo attacks in practice (basically you almost never want to use them outside of scripting stuns or saving sharpness).</li>
<li class="indent">Sliding Swipe’s iframes have been nerfed from 42 to 31 (this is at 60 FPS). For reference, a roll has 13 iframes and a backhop has 40 iframes. This is definitely not a negligible nerf, but Sliding Swipe still remains a useful defensive and positioning tool.</li></ul>
                </p>

<ul><li>AT Uth Duna armors are very good at helping alternative builds to have a better framework to work with and help us putting Lord’s Soul armor bonus into many more sets that needed some updates.</li>
<li>Apart from that, unlike the last time in TU1.5 the event quests isn’t limited anymore but you should still grab the fullset of armors for any additional uses in the future as per usual.</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
<ul><li>Burst Boost got a buff from +3/+10 to +8/+18 with the 2pc/4pc set bonus respectively. Unfortunately, after running calculations, it’s now competitive but isn’t the best set still for us (3pc Rey/2pc Odo or 4pc Odo).</li>
<li>Counter Slash’s nerf was partially reverted. It was originally 60MV, was nerfed to 50MV, and now has been buffed to 55MV.</li>
<li>New charms! What most of us theorycrafters have worked out is that they’re not worth it for the most part. You’ll need a literally perfect god charm to gain what’s basically a ~0.3% improvement over current sets using WEX2/Agi2 charms. It’s kind of weird how it turned out but turns out that weapon and armor skills are harder to interchange especially with HR armor where the slots are limited (meaning that the new charms end up taxing armor skills a bit too hard). Perhaps in future updates when skill budget gets better, the new charms will be more viable, but for now, there’s no need to feel FOMO over what other people are getting in the charm gacha.</li>
<li>Fixed the Blagonga War Cry getting overridden now meme builder rejoice! <- the dmg is still bad</ul></li>

                <p>
<ul><li>TU1 changed/added a couple of things:</li>
<li>Whiteflame Torrent: see here.</li>
<li>Maximum Might is now more lenient. Instead of losing it every 2nd roll, if you allow your stamina to reset back to full, then you can perform another roll without losing the Max Might bonus. As a result, Fulgur 2pc sets are worse off when compared to Gore 4pc sets.</li>
<li>Corrupted Mantle nerfs. However, the optimal loops to use while wearing Corrupted Mantle do not change (Y>Y>B>B)</li>
<li>Slicked Blade and Bubbly Dance: these two are dead in the water. They are not good.</li></ul>
                </p>

                <p>
<u>Weapon and armor changes:</u>
<ul><li>Zoh Shia SnS replaces G. Arkveld SnS due to Whiteflame torrent being a good damage boost.</li>
<li>Zoh Shia chest piece replaces Arkveld’s chest in 4P Gore sets, adding extra damage.</li>
<li>Zoh Shia chest piece replaces Arveld’s chest in FulGore sets, shifting it to be more Crit consistent.</li>
<li>Mizu SnS is not good compared to Artian Water SnS.</li>
<li>Added Convert element 1,3 sets, Whiteflame focused set.</li>
<li>Removed Burst 5, Corrupted Mantle sets as It is largely redundant due to other options and nerfs.</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
<u>TU1.5 - AT Rey Dau armor has been released</u>
<ul><li>3pc AT Rey Dau is a very competitive armor and can beat out 4pc Gore in a lot of situations However 4pc Gore still remains strong regardless.</li>
<li>AT Rey Helmet, arms, waist is a very competitive armor piece but due to the nature of limited events you should still grab all the armor and the charm upgrades regardless.</ul></li>
                </p>
                <p>
<u>TU1.75 - (SF6 collab) Akuma has been released</u>
<ul><li>Somehow Max Might changes is a bug so we are reverting our uptimes to 80%</li>
<li>The writer is annoyed by having to change the wording for max might again.</li></ul>

            <label for="8.0" class="CollHeading"><h3>8. Frequently Asked Questions</h3></label><div class="CollParagraph">
                <p> 
<ul><li>Q: What about Flayer, why don't we have it?</li>
    <li>A: Please see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunterMeta/comments/1jc0098/this_is_how_flayer_doesnt_work/" target="_blank">this reddit post</a> (opens in new tab) on how Flayer works (and doesn’t work). Because wounds have a wound lockout time of 20s on a BY PART basis, Flayer only has ⅓ chance to activate for wound damage, and Flayer has an internal cooldown (meaning it does not trigger on all hits of a fast attack string), Flayer does not actually help that much in making more wounds. We do suggest Flayer 1 for the flat damage proc as an alternative to Agitator or Burst 2-5. For Partbreaker, it also seems to be bugged and doesn’t work sometimes.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Q: How about Scorcher by itself or Elemental Absorption?</li>
    <li>A: Scorcher by itself (without Whiteflame Torrent) and Elemental Absorption are bad skills that don’t contribute much to damage. It’s a numbers issue.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Q: How about Binding Counter?</li>
    <li>A: Binding Counter is actually a decent skill but it’s more powerful when the hunt time is short, so that the uptime can be maximised. Because Power Clash works like a status, the first Clash is easy to get, the second one comes after some time, but the third Power Clash does not come in a reasonable amount of time. Speedrunners can get more value out of Jin Dahaad’s set skills which include Agitator and Resuscitate alongside Binding Counter (because of how short speedruns are, those skills have more value as they will have better uptime).</li></ul>

<ul><li>Q: How about Resuscitate (from Lord’s Fury - equipping 3 or more pieces of Apex monster armour)?</li>
    <li>A: As of 10/3/25, Resuscitate has been patched to no longer work post-Frenzy Cure. We’re hence not going to recommend any Resuscitate sets, and any such sets you see using this should be presumed to be outdated.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Q: Akuma?</li>
    <li>A: No I am not making akuma builds go make your own for it. - PokerDew</li></ul>

<ul><li>Q: There was a glitch about SnS having infinite plunging thrusts. How did you do that? <b>[it has been fixed by capcom]</b> as of 16/04/2025</li>
    <li>A: <a href="https://youtu.be/sXvbFOdvwiY" target="_blank">Here</a> is how you do it (youtube, opens in a new tab)(Also It’s super weird and janky with other weapon/terrain interactions 10/10 bug tho)
and it might get patched maybe soon? But it was practical enough to do runs with it, go wild - PokerDew</li></ul>

            <div class="CollParagraph">
                <p>
The Materials to craft Artian weapons are obtained from HR41+ Tempered Investigations. Good investigations look like this:
                </p>
                        <img src="sets/sword_and_shield8.1A.webp" class="BuildCard" alt="Sword and Shield Tempered Investigations">
                        <a href="sets/sword_and_shield8.1A.webp" target="_blank" class="ImgButton">Open image in new tab</a><br>
                        <span class="center">Fig. 8.1A - Investigation Examples</span>
                <p>
The three materials needed to craft a SnS are <b>1x Blade 1x Disc and 1x Tube</b>.<br>
To craft an Artian SnS, talk to Gemma and select the Forge Artian Weapon option.<br>
Next, select the parts:
                </p>
                        <img src="sets/sword_and_shield8.1B.webp" class="BuildCard" alt="Sword and Shield Artian Crafting Menu">
                        <a href="sets/sword_and_shield8.1B.webp" target="_blank" class="ImgButton">Open image in new tab</a><br>
                        <span class="center">Fig. 8.1B - Crafting Menu</span>
                <p>
                    Each part has an Element (or a Status), and either Attack or Affinity associated with it. Using two of the same Element/Status makes the resulting weapon have that Element/Status. For a pure raw weapon you want to be using 3 parts all of different status/element.<br>
                    Using the same element/status three times boosts the value a bit and is always encouraged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Current Rarity 8 Artian Weapons have a base of 190 Raw and 5% Affinity, as well as 20 units of white sharpness.<br>
                    They always have 3-3-3 slots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above example uses 3 Attack Infusions which means the resulting weapon will have 190 + (3x5) Attack and 5% Affinity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results thus work like this:

                <p> 
                    In this game, sharpening with a whetstone got buffed to occur stage-wise or in “cycles”.<br>
Each sharpening cycle restores 20 sharpness (if you’re not missing a lot of sharpness).
<ul><li>Time taken to:</li>
<li>- Take out the whetstone/whetfin from guard, and sharpen 1 cycle: ~1.4s</li>
<li>- Take out the whetstone/whetfin from guard, sharpen 1 cycle and then roll to cancel the end animation: ~2s</li>
<li>- Take out the whetstone/whetfin from guard, and sharpen 2 cycles: ~2.3s</li>
<li>- Take out the whetstone/whetfin from guard, sharpen 2 cycles and then roll to cancel the end animation: ~2.9s</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
Monsters typically run away after 3 - 4 minutes barring some unique circumstances such as Turf Wars or dying state. 
                </p>
                <p>
We will typically need about 120 - 150 sharpness per 3 minutes. This depends on the combos you do, how much sharpness they consume and your uptime on the monster.

MT at 70% affinity grants basically 2.26x your original sharpness. At 80% affinity, it grants 2.76x your original sharpness. On a base of 50 sharpness, and considering the average affinity of an Artian set,  that’s about 130 units total.<br>
Razor Sharp + Handicraft on a 50 sharpness weapon gives about 70 sharpness units, so 120 units total.<br>
Hence, MT slightly edges out Razor Sharp + Handicraft.

                <p>
<ul><li>Every time you sharpen mid-combat, you incur a direct loss of damage. Using what we know above, this multiplier can very roughly be calculated as: time spent sharpening / 180s:</li>
<li>If you sharpen once in 3 minutes, it’s a 1.1% loss</li>
<li>If you sharpen twice in 3 minutes, it’s a 2.2% loss</li>
<li>If you sharpen thrice in 3 minutes, it’s a 3.3% loss</li>
<li>If you don’t sharpen and fall down to blue, you’re losing 1.32/1.2 = 10% damage.</li></ul>
You can decrease the impact of this loss by sharpening during specific times (e.g. when the monster is not easily hittable or the monster’s best hitzone is facing away from you).
                </p>
                <p>
Most of the time, if you use a whetfin (Whetfish Fin) and have base 50 sharpness (i.e. Artian with one sharpness augment), you will need to sharpen twice every 3 minutes. If you have base 80 sharpness (i.e. Artian with two sharpness augments), you will need to sharpen once every 3 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
When we weigh sharpness management, we’re considering:
<ul><li>Master’s Touch</li>
<li>Grinder 2 + Attack Boost/Critical Eye (these are the main useful decorations with Grinder 2)</li>
<li class="indent">This adds around 0.9% damage.</li>
<li class="indent">Each sharpen restores 60 units</li>
<li>-Grinder 1 + a 2-slot deco (typically adding Critical Boost 2)</li>
<li class="indent">If adding Crit Boost 2 (baseline Crit Boost 3, so effectively Crit Boost 5): this adds around 3.5% damage at 77% average affinity (for Artian weapons)</li>
<li class="indent">Each sharpen restores 30 units.</li>
<li>No sharpness management, whetfin only + a 3-slot deco:</li>
<li class="indent">If adding OFG3/ele attack 1: this adds around 5.5% damage</li>
<li class="indent">If adding OFG3 alone: this adds around 5.1% damage.</li>
<li class="indent">If adding Crit Boost 2 (baseline Crit Boost 3, so effectively Crit Boost 5): this adds around 3.5% damage at 77% average affinity (for Artian weapons)</li>
<li class="indent">If adding Crit Boost 3 (baseline Crit Boost 0): this adds around 5.5% damage at 77% average affinity (for Artian weapons)</li>
<li class="indent">If adding Ele Attack 3/Crit Ele 1: this adds around 1.2% damage</li>
<li class="indent">If adding Attack Boost 3: this adds around 3.5% damage</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
Hence, my rough conclusions are as follows: <b>(all sharpens are assuming you use whetfin and perform only 1 cycle sharpens)</b>
<ul><li>-If your weapon needs to choose between OFG3, Crit Boost 3 and MT, and you can only fit two:</li>
<li class="indent">Use OFG3/ele attack + Crit Boost 3, if you only need to sharpen 4 times per 3 minutes.</li>
<li class="indent">Use MT + either OFG3/ele attack or CB3 for comfort if you don’t want to sharpen so much.</li>
<li>If your weapon already has OFG3 or Crit Boost 3 (e.g. as part of weapon skill):</li>
<li class="indent">Always slot in the other skill (whichever one you’re missing between OFG3 and CB3)</li>
<li class="indent">Add on either AB3, Crit Boost 2 if you only need to sharpen 3 times per 3 minutes.</li>
<li class="indent">Use MT instead of AB3/CB2 for comfort if you don’t want to sharpen so much.</li>
<li>If you’re using an Artian weapon with baseline 50 sharpness after Sharpness Aug x1</li>
<li class="indent">Add on either AB3, Crit Boost 2, if you only need to sharpen 3 times per 3 minutes.</li>
<li class="indent">Use MT instead of AB3/CB2 for comfort if you don’t want to sharpen so much.</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
If you don’t have wetfins:
<ul><li>If you want to use Speed Sharpening over MT.</li>
<li class="indent">Grinder 2 doesn’t seem to be worth it, the moment you sharpen once during combat, you’re already losing out to MT.</li>
<li class="indent">Grinder 1 only replenishes 30 sharpness per cycle. If let’s say you use a 2 cycle-sharpen every time (so 60 sharpness gain, taking 2.9s), you would lose 1.6% with every sharpen across 180s. Since using Grinder 1 lets you slot in AB3 or CB2, both of which give around 3.5%, you would be okay to use Grinder 1 over MT if you only needed to sharpen twice every 180s, which I think is reasonable.  This requires a weapon with base 60 sharpness.</li>
<li>If you don’t want to use Speed Sharpening</li>
<li class="indent">Always use MT over other skills, unless you only need to sharpen once every 180s (e.g. base sharpness of 80 or higher).</li></ul>
                </p>
                <p>
Not everyone is a speedrunner. For the sets, we will put MT as the default sharpness management option. If you want to use the other sharpness management options, take note that the gain you get is really going to be <=5%, and that described gain is the theoretical max and assumes you don’t sharpen at all. Every time you sharpen, you lose out some of the advantage from not having MT:
<li>For example, if you use Grinder 1 and add in AB3 and you do sharpen twice every 180s as per the threshold listed above, the advantage you would have gained is 0.1%. If you only sharpen once with Grinder 1, the advantage you gain is 1.8%.</li>
You basically need to beat, not just match the thresholds described above to gain any worthwhile advantage. That requires you to pay a lot of attention to how you use your sharpness over time, or that requires you to sharpen during times when you wouldn’t be able to deal effective damage anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
tl;dr: Use MT unless you’re really min-maxing, you’re a speedrunner, you know how to prolong your sharpness by switching up your attacks, you know how to sharpen at the correct times to minimise the impact of downtime on the hunt, and you don’t mind interrupting combat every so often to sharpen. It’s viable and practical to not use MT, but you need to know what you’re doing.
