        <p>
          Hammer is a Weapon of Medium Mobility and Strong hits Coupled with its Pretty Close Quarters reach, The Weapon had a Big redesign compared to the Older generation where it's trying to be less Charge centric and more Combo Oriented, We retain the Keeping Sway from Sunbreak at the cost of lowered Distance,
          And a Offset-Attack with any <span class="tooltip">Upswing<span class="tooltiptext">Upswing, Spinning-Bludgeon Upswing, Charged Upswing, Mighty-Charge Upswing.</span></span> With the Golf-swings you get the ability to hold it and release it as we wish. This makes Hammer have a more Risky Playstyle compared to the older iterations of wanting more Methodical Positioning and timing. <br> This weapon is for you if you:

      <div class="CollParagraph">
        <p>
          Hammer has 3 Notable Playstyles: <br>
          <b>Charge: </b> Focuses on <span class="controls-zr-button">ZR</span> and Landing as many Charge 3's and Mighty Charge Moves as possible. Tends to favour Snipe/Hit and run Styles.<br><br>
          <b>Triple Pound: </b> A more Off-set Heavy and Risky playstyle based on Weaving attacks in between monster moves and off-setting them if possible.<br><br>
          <b>Spin: </b> A Heavily Elemental based playstyle focused on using Spinning Bludgeon to dish out as much element as possible.<br><br><br>

          <u><b>Utility: Charge Step</b></u><br>
          During Charging or Right after a Dodge, You can press <span class="controls-zr-button">A</span> or <span class="controls-zr-button">ZR</span> + <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> Respectively, Doing so will initiate a Charged Step giving you Iframes and letting you keep any charge level if you had been charging.

        6. Optimal Combos</h3>
      </label>

      <div class="CollParagraph">
        <p>
          <b><u>Big Bang Mighty Charge Slam</u></b><br>
          The highest damage combo reserved for KO's and Longer Downs.<br>
          Big Bang 1 > Big Bang 2 > Big Bang 3 > Big Bang 4 > Mighty Charge > Mighty Charge Slam <br>
          <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-zr-button">ZR</span> + <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> + <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > Charge > Release <span class="controls-zr-button">ZR</span> <br>
          A Concentrated Combo of 491 <span class="tooltip">MV<span class="tooltiptext">Motion Value.</span></span> Blunt Goodness. However it has a very long time and would recommend using Focus 3 if you want to use it since its that long.<br><br>

          <b><u>Big Bang</u></b><br>
          in a down where Mighty charge is not possible but you're still close / Have Maximum Might set. Big Bang is still a good relatively quicker combo and leaves you able to chain into a Triple pound For offset.<br>
          Big Bang 1 > Big Bang 2 > Big Bang 3 > Big Bang 4 > Big Bang Finisher.<br>
          <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-a-button">A</span><br>
          Falls slightly Behind the previous combo as it deals 437 <span class="tooltip">MV<span class="tooltiptext">Motion Value.</span></span> But is Much faster to do and does not require Focus and more forgiving in windows.<br><br>

          <b><u>Triple Pound Loop</u></b><br>
          The bread and Butter of Hammer combos.
          Overhead Smash 1 > Overhead Smash 2 > <span class="tooltip">Upswing<span class="tooltiptext">Also Commonly named as Golf-swing.</span></span><br>
          <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> > <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> > <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> <br>
          Dont let the length of the combo trick you. this is a very high dps combo should you land it due to its very short time of execution. the final hit of it being an offset means you tend to do this either sniping head hits of fishing of offsets using it. <br><br>

          <b><u>Triple Pound <span class="tooltip">MCS<span class="tooltiptext">Mighty Charge Slam.</span></span></u></b><br>
          Same as Previous Combo however at the end of the Upswing we do a Mighty Charge input. This is for either downs mid combo or fishing for Flinches and KO's.

          <b><u>Spinning Bludgeon <span class="tooltip">MCu<span class="tooltiptext">Mighty Charge Upswing.</span></span></u></b><br>
          Our Primo elemental Combo. Focused on dishing the most Element on monsters with a heavy elemental head weakness.<br>
          Any Move > Spinning Bludgeon 1,2,3,4,5 > Spinning Bludgeon Upswing > Charge > Might Charge Upswing<br>
          <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> + <span class="controls-a-button">A</span> > <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> > <span class="controls-zr-button">ZR</span> + <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> + <span class="controls-a-button">A</span>

          <b><u>Spinning Upswing</u></b><br>
          Holding <span class="controls-x-button">X</span> While spinning will cost you 1 Tick however will instantly make your Player Hold the upswing when its possible.<br><br>
          <b><u>Offset Follow-up</u></b><br>
          You can Spin up to 5 times before you spinout. Pressing Instantly will skip the spin useful if the monster wasnt actually flinched. However spinning out is also useful as you get put into Overhead Smash 2 which means you may chain into another Upswing.<br><br>
          <b><u>Focus Strike</u></b><br>
          During the Focus strike spin you can hold the Charge button to charge to instantly Chain into Mighty charge or Not hold it and get put into Overhead Smash for another Upswing chain.
