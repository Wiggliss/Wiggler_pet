            <h3>1.0 - Obtain Guide</h3>
        </label>
    
        <div class="collapsible-contentParagraphs">
            <div class="collapsible-content-inside">
                <div class="GuideParagraphText">
                    <p> <h3>Step 1</h3>
                        Define what your guide is exactly: is it a meta set compilation for rise, or a tutorial on how to get into speedrunning?<br>
                        Once you've done that, find the folder your guide will be in; it should be self-explanatory, but if you don't understand it, ask and I'll add a section on to how to do that.<br>
                        
                        <h3>Step 2</h3>
                        Add all your planned pictures in .webp format to the "pictures" folder (might be labelled differently), and make sure their names are in the same format as the other files in there. The first image in the Switch Axe document is "switch_axe1", the third image in the Heavy Bowgun document is "heavy_bowgun3", and so on.
                        Make sure you don't capitalize: everything is case-sensitive. <br> 
                        <h3>Step 3</h3>
                        Most of your work from here will be Copy-Pasting. The general Structure of Weapon-related guides is done, you just need to paste the words in the labelled spots and make sure the Images you want to use have the <b>EXACT NAME</b> as found within the html. <br>
                        If the image reference says "swaxe1" for example, name it exactly that. Don't get fancy with capitalization, as this whole thing is extremely case sensitive. Don't add spaces either.<br>
                        Example of how that's supposed to look:<br>
                        <img src="Sitewide_Images/vssample2.GIF" width="60%"><br><br>
                        <h3>Step 4</h3>
                        If you want to check your work, open a new tab (or better: window) in your browser, then press CTRL+O to open a file and select the html file you wish to check, the same way you opened this locally. Here, you can edit as much as you'd like as it's purely visible to you.
                        Make sure you grab screenshots of the tables you use, as they tend to break on mobile view (which the majority of people will use).

                <p> You will receive a folder from the pins in our discord. <br>
                    This folder contains the complete layout of the website, aswell as some (sample) pictures to help show where stuff goes and what the naming conventions are, alongside the stylesheets we use (don't worry about them).

        <h3>3.0 - How assets work and other important tidbits (haha tids)</h3>
    </label>

    <div class="collapsible-contentParagraphs">
        <div class="collapsible-content-inside">
            <div class="GuideParagraphText">
                <p> Paragraph 6.0 contains a list of all the classes we currently use. <br>
                    You use the classes, by putting them in a &lt;span class="ClassNameHere"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;div class="ClassNameHere"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. <br>
                    &lt;br&gt; is used to make a linebreak <br>
                    like <br>
                    so <br>
                    . <br>
                    Classes will then be used for the stuff that follows, like so: <br>
                    &lt;span class="redscroll"&gt; text &lt;/span&gt; will then display as <span class="redscroll">text</span>, for example. <br>
                    Classes basically tell the website to "look at the stylesheet, find this exact name, apply its effects to this" and "stop applying it here" by using: &lt;/span&gt; or &lt;/div&gt;, depending on what you used. <br><br>
                    Most of this will be pre-formatted for you, so you don't actually need to learn what all of them do, however, if you decide to write a non-standard/"other" guide, it'll be helpful to understand them. If there's something you want to do that's not covered by
                    the existing classes, or aren't sure (after consulting 6.0) what they do, please reach out to Sasch and I'll either implement them for you, or help you understand. <br>
                    &lt;span class="ClassNameHere"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; <-- these things are called tags. Most tags you open will need to be closed again, too, otherwise the site might break. VS code is useful here, as you can minimize the tags you used which shows you what all is considered as part of that tag, making troubleshooting easier. <br>
                    Generally speaking, as long as you copy-paste properly and only fill in the obviously labelled spots, it'll work fine. <br>
                    If you need to point at a stylesheet or a script, we use something called relative links. They work by telling the html code the name of the file you're trying to access. If that file is in a different folder, you'll need to tell it to look in that folder, like so: <br>
                    &lt;link href="Folder/File.type"&gt; <br>
                    If you need to go "up" a folder, you indicate this by using ../, like: href="../Folder/Folder/File.type", still in the funni brackets. <br>
                    Your main use case for this will be when embedding images, like so: <br>
                    &lt;img src="Sitewide_Images/vssample.GIF" class="BuildCard"&gt;, which will display it as such: <br>
                    <img src="Sitewide_Images/vssample.GIF" class="BuildCard"> <br>
                    Note that since we host on GitHub, <u><b>EVERYTHING IS CASE SENSITIVE</b></u>. This will be your second most common error. <br><br><br>
                    Make sure, absolutely sure, that: <br>
                    <li>Files have the correct name</li><br>
                    <li>Files are in the correct folder </li><br>
                    <li>Files have the correct format </li><br>
                    <li>If you work with how to play guides: your videos on youtube are about 3 minutes long, unlisted and in the correct playlist.</li>

            <div class="GuideParagraphText">
                <p> As previously mentioned, the second most common error you will do is capitalization of filenames that are not capitalized. <br>
                    The most common thing you will do is either forgetting to remove comments (shown green in vs code), or not closing a div. <br>
                    You test for those by navigating to the folder the file you refer to, most commonly: images are located at and check their spelling versus yours. <br>
                    For forgotten closed divs or spans, you can click on the tag (they're blue) and it'll show you where its closed, or on the little arrow next to it to minimize everything it encapsulates. <br>
                    If it goes on for far longer than you want it to, slap your closing tag after where you want it to close. <br>
                    Another common mistake you will make is referring to folders that aren't there, by forgetting to go up enough (or going up too many) steps with ../ - this too you can fix by just checking where everything actually is. <br>
                    Note that this type of link is called relative link, as it's relative to the file you're typing in, in your case: 99 times out of 100, the html file, so you need to follow the path from there. <br>
                    The last easy to fix but important to remember mistake is re-using ids. An id is a one-time-use name, given to a specific object. You will find them in the Collapsible Headers, where you'll need to make sure that the input id="THIS" and the  label for="THIS" match. <br>
                    To prevent confusion, I recommend just using the numbers you gave your paragraphs, like "1.0", "1.1", "2.0" and so on.

                <p> &lt;div data-content&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - This div starts before any of your headers you want in your Table of Contents, and ends after all of them you want included. This makes the javascript auto-generate said toc. <br><br>

                    &lt;div data-toc&gt;&lt;/div&gt; - This goes to where the table of content is supposed to be. Usually, this will be prepared for you already. <br><br>
                    
                    &lt;burger-menu&gt;&lt;/burger-menu&gt; - This is for the Burger Menu, which will also be prepared for you usually. If it is not (and you're sure there's supposed to be one), this string goes into the the part where it says &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; <br><br>
                    
                    &lt;footer-bar&gt;&lt;/footer-bar&gt; - This goes at almost the very bottom, and will also usually be prepared for you. This pastes the code for the Footer.
                    
                    &lt;div id="controls-dropdown-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; and &lt;span class="controls-zr-button"&gt;ZR&lt;/span&gt; - This is the dropdown for the automatic button input "translator". It can get a little tiresome to use, but is also completely re-usable. Note that This
                    refers to the standard button configuration and can not accomodate for custom inputs. It is based off of the Switch Controller Inputs, which can be changed if the demand is popular. <br><br>

                    gamememe - Used for the game-specific meme, like amazon primordial or the fatalis one. <br><br>
                    
                    h1-h6 - An automatic class, that indicates Headings. You use them like so: <br>&lt;h2&gt;Heading!&lt;/h2&gt; <br> <h2>Heading!</h2> <br> They are mostly pre-configured, but can be customized, if so desired. Any heading exceeding h6, like h7, h8... will need to be custom defined first. I recommend sticking to h2 for big headings like titles, and to h3 for literally everything else.

                    &lt;u&gt;text&lt;/u&gt; - underlines <u>text</u><br>  
                    &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt; - makes <i>text</i> <s>illiterate</s> italic<br>
                    &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; - makes <b>text</b> bold <br>
                    &lt;s&gt;text&lt;/s&gt; - strikes <s>text</s> through.
                    
                    <br><br>collapsible-contentParagraphs <br>
                    CollHeader - Classes used to make collapsibles work, usually provided by the asset or pre-prepared for you.
                    <br><br>ParagraphText - Used in conjunction with the above, for text paragraphs. Optional, technically, but should be included for ease of styling (aka making it look good). <br>

                                          &lt;td&gt;Forward Overhead Slash is a long commitment, gap-closing move that can lead into triple sword slash. Forward Slash can be used to quickly reposition and inch closer, if needed.
                                      Realistically, you’ll always Morph Draw, making the pick preference based. &lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;/tr&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;tr&gt; <br>
                                      &lt;th scope="row"&gt;2&lt;/th&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;td class="best"&gt;Finishing Discharge&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;td colspan="2"class="bad"&gt;Compressed Finishing Discharge&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;td&gt;Finishing Discharge turns into Zero Sum Discharge when the weapon is amped, which has amazing utility. It shouldn’t be relied upon for standard gameplay/main damage output, but its possibilities shouldn’t be understated, either.
                                      Don’t use it without SWB.&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;/tr&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;tr&gt; <br>
                                      &lt;th scope="row"&gt;3&lt;/th&gt; <br>
                                          &lt;td&gt;Axe: Wide Sweep&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                          &lt;td colspan="2" class="best"&gt;2-Staged Morph Slash Combo&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                          &lt;td&gt;2-Stage generates gauge and gives a good amount of amp if you complete it, allows you to always enter sword mode and is affected by RM, whereas wide sweep isn't.
                                      Neither are great for their damage, but 2-Stage helps with upkeep on, fittingly, 2 fronts, and is a very welcome addition to the moveset.&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;/tr&gt; <br>
                                        &lt;tr&gt; <br>

                                          &lt;td class="good"&gt;Wire Step&lt;/td&gt; <br>
                                          &lt;td&gt;Vincible Gambit is a low damage, long commitment hyper armor move, of which we already have 2 to choose from. Slot Intrepid Heart 1.
                                      Wirestep is a good provider of iframes, using 1 Fast recovery Wirebug and is capable of dropping hellfire. 
                                      Soaring wyvern is a must if you ever plan on using ZSD as it skips the recovery animation.&lt;/td&gt; <br>

                    <br><br>GuideCardMobile - This class is for screenshots of the tables you use, which will not work on phones, within the guides specifically. This will usually be prepared for you, just make sure your screenshot is named correctly, in the right folder and of the .webp format.
                    <br><br>best <br>
                    good <br>
                    bad <br>
                    redscroll <br>
                    bluescroll - <span class="best">best</span>, <span class="good">good</span>, <span class="bad">bad</span> - mostly used to highlight the best/good/bad options for switch skill table. <span class="redscroll">redscroll</span> and <span class="bluescroll">bluescroll</span> are used to show which scroll to play the set on/which scroll is prefered.
                    <br> Use with "span" for best results, like so: &lt;span class="good"&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; -> <span class="good">good</span>.
                    <br><br>tooltip <br>
                    tooltiptext - used for the hover-over effect. Tooltip indicates where you have to hover, tooltiptext is the content of the resulting pop-up. You will need to span the whole thing with both classes. 
                    <br>use like so:  the meta - here:  &lt;span class="tooltip"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most efficent tactic available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span class="tooltiptext"&gt;that is casually achievable, no heroics etc here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    <br>the meta - here: <span class="tooltip"><u>most efficent tactic available</u><span class="tooltiptext">that is casually achievable, no heroics etc here.</span></span> <br>hover over "most efficent tactic available" to see the result.
