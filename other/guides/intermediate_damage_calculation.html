                    This guide serves as an Introduction to the Damage Calculation in Monster Hunter. It provides a quick overview of the different terms in the calculation, what they are composed of, examples of what they are affected by and where to find them.</p>

                <p>
                    It was authored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaYHJCjjf4U9yUdhszkUXA">Sasch</a> and Dickchess, and reviewed by Kat with feedback by Aki.</p>

                <p>
                    The (simplified) Formula for Damage is the following:</p>
                    <p class="center">
                    (((Base Raw x Raw%) + Flat Raw) x Post Raw) x Sharpness x Crit x Motion Value x Hitzone <br>
+<br>
(((Base Ele x Ele%) + Flat Ele) x Post Ele) x Sharpness x Crit Ele x Elemod x Ele Hitzone<br>
	=<br>
	Damage                    
                </p>
                <p>

            Base Raw refers to the amount of raw damage present on the weapon itself. Base Raw is exclusive to the weapon.</p> 

<p>            Note that some games have Bloat, meaning that weapon stats are multiplied by some number Capcom deems good. Most good resources show Base Raw alongside Bloated Raw where applicable.
Typically, the only possible Base Raw increases stem from Augments and Augment-Like systems, such as Qrafting for Weapons in Sunbreak, or Augments and Custom Augments themselves in World.</p>

<p>Base Raw = Base (weapon) + modifiers</p>

            Raw % refers to everything that grants raw based on Base Raw. 
            Examples of this are Attack Boost from Rise onwards, Heroics* (armor skills) and Adrenaline* (food skill).</p>
            <p>Some sources of this are game specific, such as Power Phials and Attack Up Songs in Wilds. Additionally, all those sources scale multiplicatively, 
                so gaining 10% - or a multiplier of 1.1 -  from Attack Boost and 30% - or 1.3 - from Heroics results in a total modifier of 43%, or 1.43.</p>

            <p>Examples of this are armor skills such as Attack Boost and Burst, but also Power Charm/Talon, Might Seed, certain gesture-dependent Food skills, and using Meat as an ingredient in Wilds specifically.</p>

            Post-Modifiers are relatively rare and are applied at the end of (Raw) Damage Calculation. 
            Sources for this type of modifier depend on the game.</p> 
            <p>Pre-Wilds, Power Phials acted as such. Other examples are Frostcraft, Grinder (s), Anti-Species and Silkbind Boost Rampage skills. Similar to Raw%, these apply multiplicatively.</p>

            Motion Value (MV) is the term used to refer to how strong specific weapon attacks are.</p>
            <p>These are usually given as a percentage; an attack with a motion value of 24 would do 24% of the true raw if there were no other modifiers.</p>

<p>MV can typically be found in datamines, or on one of the more accurate calculator sheets and websites.

                            <p> 
            Affinity is the weapon stat that governs your critical hit rate. It can be positive or negative. Negative affinity results in critical failures: if your weapon has -30% affinity, that means that there is a 30% chance to do <b>less</b> 
            damage than usual.</p>

<p>By default, in Monster Hunter Wilds, crits do 25% more damage, and negative crits do 25% less damage. 
    The amount of damage critical hits can do is affected by the weapon skill “Critical Boost.”<br>
    The damage modifiers for each level of Critical Boost in Wilds are shown in the table below. Critical Boost doesn’t change the damage of negative crits.</p>

    <table class="rawtable">
        <tr>
            <th>Negative Crit</th>
            <td>Crit Boost 0</td>
            <td>Crit Boost 1</td>
            <td>Crit Boost 2</td>
            <td>Crit Boost 3</td>
            <td>Crit Boost 4</td>
            <td>Crit Boost 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>0.75</th>
            <td>1.25</td>
            <td>1.28</td>
            <td>1.31</td>
            <td>1.34</td>
            <td>1.37</td>
            <td>1.40</td>
        </tr>
        <tfoot>

        </tr>
    </tfoot>
    </table>
<p>
To estimate the amount of damage that your affinity will contribute to your weapon’s overall damage, calculate a weighted average of damage for non critical hits. For example, if you have 95% affinity with Critical Boost 3 in Wilds, since you aren’t critting 5% of the time, you would get a average critical modifier of</p>
<p>1*0.95*1.34+1*0.05 -> (1+(0.34*0.95)) = 1.323,</p>
<p>so a weapon with 100 true raw would on average be doing as much damage as a 132.3 true raw weapon without affinity.</p>

<p>There are some important caveats.<br>
The first is that some attacks are unable to crit at all, and so do not benefit from having higher affinity whatsoever.<br>
These tend to be fixed damage hits like Gunlance shells. <br>
Fixed damage is rare enough that most weapons and playstyles benefit greatly from building affinity sets, but others get next to no benefit because so much of their damage comes from these fixed attacks.</p>

<p>The second is that there is no benefit to having more than 100% affinity. As a result, you should try to tailor your sets to not go over 100%.</p>

<p>The last is that most skills have uptimes; while some give you affinity consistently, like Critical Eye and Weakness Exploit, others, like Agitator and Latent Power, have unavoidable periods where they give you no affinity. 
If you want to be especially accurate in your calculations, you will need to calculate your average affinity by multiplying the affinity given from the skill by the percentage of the hunt it’s active. Unfortunately, this changes based on skill, matchup, weapon and playstyle, so you will need to determine this for yourself.

            Sharpness is a Post-Modifier. Technically speaking, it acts as a Hitzone Modifier, i.e. (Hitzone x Sharpness). Note that the specific values sharpness provides can vary on a game-by-game basis, especially in older entries. Sharpness applies as a flat number modifier, e.g.
… x 1.32 … for White Sharpness.

            Hitzone Value is the modifier associated with the part of a Monster that is hit by an attack. 
            They can be thought of as a monster's defenses. 
            These numbers can be found on dedicated sheets and websites, as well as some adjacent online tools such as some damage calculators or builders.</p>

                            <p>
            Similar to MV, they are effectively % values. They interact with certain skills such as Weakness Exploit and Mind’s Eye (as a condition to apply these skills), 
            and can be affected by Tenderizing (World/Iceborne), Waterblight (Rise/Sunbreak), and Wounded State (Wilds).</p>

<p>Attacking a hitzone of 50 means 50% of your previously calculated raw damage gets dealt to the monster, a hitzone of 20 translates to 20%. Different damage types have different hitzone values, 
    meaning a monster may have different weak points for slash, blunt and shot.</p>

<p>Note that in some games, bouncing applies an additional penalty to (raw) damage dealt.
Bouncing is determined by Sharpness Modifier x HZV, on a per-game-basis.

            Ele% refers to everything that grants element based on Base Element. Examples of this are Element Attack, and Coalescence. Some sources of this are game specific, such as Element Phials and Element Up Songs in Wilds.<br>
            Additionally, all those sources scale multiplicatively, so gaining 20% - or a multiplier of 1.2 -  from Element Attack and 10% - or 1.1 - from Coalescence results in a total modifier of 32%, or 1.32. </p>

            an attack with an elemod of 1 applies 100% of the Weapons element against a target hitzone. An elemod of 0.35 applies 35%, and an elemod of 1.5 applies 150%.</p>

            Elemental crit works similarly to raw crit, but there are some important differences. By default, critical hits do not increase the amount of elemental damage you do, only raw damage.</p>

<p>In order for a critical hit to affect elemental damage, you need to have the weapon skill “Crit Element”. Similar to Raw, once Crit Element is used, its modifier applies as a multiplier at the end of the Damage Calculation.</p>
The exact Crit Ele modifier depends on Game, and sometimes by Weapon.
In Rise, these are:
<table class="rawtable">

    <tr>
        <td>Crit Ele Level</td>

<p>Otherwise, the same benefits and caveats apply as the raw section. If you were running a 95% Affinity Long Sword with 28 Element and Crit Element 3, that would result in a modifier of</p><p>1.15*0.95+1*0.05 = 1.1425,</p><p>

            Hitzones function the same way for element as they do for raw, but again have separate values. In fact, each element has a separate value! Monsters are not as uniformly weak to elements as the Hunters notes may imply.</p>

<p>For example, Rey Dau’s head (his weakest, read: best elemental hitzone) has a hitzone value of 25, but his legs are a 5 ice hitzone, meaning that your ice damage will be only ⅕ as effective if you hit his legs. </p>

<p>A monster may have different weakest hitzones for raw and element, as well.<br>
Rise's Crimson Glow Valstrax for example has a 55 (cut) hitzone at its head, but when it enrages, it becomes immune to element except on its forelegs, which are only a 25 (cut) hitzone, but 25 for every non-dragon Element.

        4. Status</h3></label>
        
        <div class="CollParagraph">
            <p> 
Status works somewhat similarly to elemental damage, with a few important distinctions. First is that it does no direct damage to the monster. 
Instead, every time you deal status damage, you are building up to a hidden threshold. When the threshold is reached, the status is applied.</p>
<p>This is the case whether the status is from your weapon, innate to your weapon type (like stun) or from other sources. These thresholds get higher in multiplayer hunts and after every time you apply the status. 
    Like with element, crits do not affect the amount of status build up you deal unless you have the “Critical Status” skill.</p>

<p>Second, most status weapons do not actually deal status damage every hit. They have, on average, a 1 in 3 chance to apply status on most attacks. Often this 1 in 3 is achieved by a hardcoded 10 in 30 chance, 
    meaning that the game forces 10 attacks out of 30 to deal status. This can lead to situations where status is applied really quickly at first, i.e. proc 10 times back to back, but not at all afterwards,
     i.e. the remaining 20 hits of that 30 hit cluster. You can tell when this happens from the associated visual effect.</p>
     
     <p>There are a rare few exceptions to this, such as Bowgun ammo and Hunting Horn echo waves, which deal a fixed amount of status damage on every attack.</p>

<p>Third, like element, status vulnerability differs between monsters. Not only does it determine how hard it is to apply the status, but a monster with a higher status resistance will not suffer as severe effects as a monster weak to status.
These values can be found in some more advanced calculators, as well as dedicated monster info pages, see section 8.</p>

<p>Also note that Status does not scale with sharpness.</p>

<p>As a result, it can be somewhat difficult to determine how much damage is added to your weapon from status buildups without use of an external tool.

<p>Switch Axe Phial ticks can crit in World and Wilds, but not in Rise.<br>
Additionally, Switch Axe Phials can apply as base modifier like in Wilds, or as post modifier like in Rise. In older games, they can act as MV modifiers specifically, which is important for things like clearing Frenzy.
Additionally, Status Phials in Wilds break the standard 10/30 convention of applying Status and guarantee them instead.</p>

Bowgun ammo and Bow shots typically don’t have sharpness values attached. Instead, they operate on Critical Distance, which is a negative modifier of 1 while it applies, 
and gets lower in (game-dependent) tiers depending on how far out of range you are. 
<p>Sometimes Super Critical Distance is an additional tier, which typically is a modifier greater than 1. Critical Distance technically is a MV modifier.</p>
<p>Guns do not have an element stat and scale off of their raw stat instead, even for elemental ammo, which functions similar to Gunlance shells' innate fire damage.<br>
    Elemental ammo has matching innate base element damage attached.<br>
    Additionally, a lot of damage comes from repeated ticks in cases such as Pierce projectiles, which have their own variance such as FPS dependent calculations, or entering/exiting hitboxes depending on the specific line taken.</p>
<p>Some ammo types behave differently depending on the game. An example of this is the old Normal 3 ammo, which would bounce around, introducing a different type of variance than Pierce. 
    Bow additionally sometimes has charge modifiers attached, similar to Greatsword (but not necessarily applied as an extended hitzone modifier).</p>
    <p>These differences can only accurately be determined by rigorous testing, and as such are often just available in dedicated communities.

Much like Hunters, in some games, Monsters have a defense Value too. Specifically, a defense modifier.<br>
A modern example of this is World. Damage gets calculated against that defense modifier. These modifiers typically vary between quests, like in World Investigations.</p>
<p>
    Sometimes these values swing between 0.97 and 1.03, some more extreme Examples are present in Frontier, where they can go all the way to 3%, meaning you only deal 3% of the damage you should be dealing.<br>
    Sometimes, Poison specifically gets around this modifier, often making it reasonably strong in those games.

Sometimes the approach to rounding changes.<br>
In Rise, the formula was<br>
FLOOR(((Base raw x Raw%) + Flat raw) x Horn Songs) +0.1) x Post Raw for raw,<br>
and a similar order of operations for element.</p>
<p>Rarely, these operations can differ between Weapons even in the same game. Considering the inconsistent nature of rounding approaches and the small, albeit measurable, 
    impact of rounding errors, as well as the difficulties in verifying “old gen” math, the authors have decided against an in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Rounding is often discovered and reversed by the most dedicated Theory-folk and as such most easily available in these circles, albeit rarely steadily.
